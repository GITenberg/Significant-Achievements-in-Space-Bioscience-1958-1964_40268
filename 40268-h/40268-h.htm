progress made during the period 1958 through 1964
in discipline areas covered by the Space Science and
Applications Program of the United States. In this
way, the contribution made by the National Aeronautics

the background of overall progress in each discipline.
Succeeding issues will document the results from later
years.</p>
<p class="pnext">The initial issue of this series appears in 10 volumes
(NASA Special Publications 91 to 100) which describe
the achievements in the following areas: Astronomy,
Bioscience, Communications and Navigation, Geodesy,
Ionospheres and Radio Physics, Meteorology, Particles
and Fields, Planetary Atmospheres, Planetology, and
Solar Physics.</p>
<p class="pnext">Although we do not here attempt to name those who
have contributed to our program during these first 6
years, both in the experimental and theoretical research
and in the analysis, compilation, and reporting of
results, nevertheless we wish to acknowledge all the
contributions to a very fruitful program in which this
country may take justifiable pride.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">T</span><span class="dropspan small-caps">his summary of certain aspects</span> of the space biology program of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration brings together
some results of NASA research and NASA-sponsored research under
grants and contracts from 1958 through 1964. Closely related research
even though not sponsored by NASA is also included.</p>
<p class="pnext">The space biology program has had a late start in comparison with
the space physics program, and only a token program existed before 1962.
Much of the present research involves preparation of space-flight experiments
and obtainment of adequate baseline information. Perhaps half
the research results reported are derived from the NASA program.
Additional information is included from many other sources, especially
the U.S. Air Force with its long history of work in aviation and aerospace
medicine.</p>
<p class="pnext">Relatively few biological space-flight experiments have been undertaken.
These have been to test life-support systems and to demonstrate,
before manned space flight, an animal's capability to survive. Few
critical biological experiments have been placed in orbit by NASA, but
a biosatellite program will soon make a detailed study of the fundamental
biological effects of weightlessness, biorhythms, and radiation.</p>
<p class="pnext">The search for extraterrestrial life has been limited to ground-based
research and planning for planetary and lunar landings. Life-detection
experiments have been developed and tested, and an important and
exciting program is being planned to detect and study extraterrestrial
life, if it exists.</p>
<p class="pnext">Interest in space biology has been slow in developing, and there has
been some caution and controversy in the scientific community. However,
increased interest is starting to push forward the frontier of this
new and important scientific field, and future outlook appears to be
optimistic.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">T</span><span class="dropspan small-caps">he biological program</span> of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration had a late start. A small life sciences group, organized
in 1958, was concerned with life support and use of primates for
system and vehicle testing for the Mercury program. Three small suborbital
flights of biological materials were flown in space.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Bioscience Program Office of the Office of Space Science and Applications
was organized in 1962. The goals of the Bioscience Program are:
(1) to determine if extraterrestrial life exists anywhere in the solar system
and to study its origin, nature, and level of development, if it is present;
(2) to determine the effects of space and planetary environments on
Earth organisms, including man; (3) to conduct biological research to
develop life support and protective measures for extended manned space
flight; and (4) to develop fundamental theories in biology relative to
origin, development, and relationship to environment. Research and
development has been carried out to design life-detection experiments
and instruments for future flights to Mars and to develop experiments
to study the effects of the space environment on living organisms. A biosatellite
program, started in 1963, has the first of six flights scheduled
for 1966.</p>
<p class="pnext">Space exploration has demanded a rigorous development, especially in
the biosciences area. Investigation of the solar system for exotic life
forms, the environmental extremes to which Earth organisms (including
man) are being exposed, the possibilities for modification of planetary
environments by biological techniques yet to be developed, and the
problems of communication in biosystems are areas which have required
refinement of the theoretical framework of biology before progress could
be made rapidly enough to keep pace with technological advances in
transportation.</p>
<p class="pnext">Of all the sciences, biology alone has not yet benefited from comparisons
with the universe beyond Earth. It is reasonable to suppose that
breakthroughs might be made in biology on the basis of comparisons
<span class="pageno target" title="2" id="page-2"> </span>with life from other worlds. Organisms elsewhere may have found
alternatives to processes we think of as basic characteristics of life.</p>
<p class="pnext">In contrast, physical science has advanced sufficiently to provide a great
body of laws which may be expressed in mathematical terms, and by
which phenomena may be predicted with complete accuracy. A well-known
characteristic of biological phenomena is variability. The
Darwinian concept of evolution is perhaps the only pervading generalization
in biology. This concept has been supported by evidence of a
hereditary mechanism in the discovery of genes and gene mutations.</p>
<p class="pnext">Space bioscience represents the convergence of main disciplines with
a single orientation, whose direction is determined by the problems of
manned space travel which have, in turn, created a host of bioengineering
problems concerned with supporting man in space.</p>
<p class="pnext">Foremost among these questions is the possibility of the existence of
extraterrestrial life. The field which is concerned with the search for
extraterrestrial life has come <span class="target" id="to-be-called-exobiology">to be called "exobiology."</span> In addition to
the challenge of great technological problems which must be solved,
exobiology is so closely related to the central scientific questions in
biological science that it is considered by some to be the most significant
pursuit in all of science.</p>
<p class="pnext">One of the major opportunities already presented by the advances in
propulsion systems is the ability to escape from the influence of the Earth,
which has made possible the study of organism-environment relationships,
particularly the role that environmental stimuli play in the establishment
and maintenance of normal organization in living systems.</p>
<p class="pnext">Transcending even these formidable objectives of space bioscience is
an objective shared by all life sciences, the discovery of nature's scheme
for coding the messages contained in biological molecules. Extraterrestrial
biology seeks to find not only evidence of life now present, but
the vestigial chemicals of its previous existence. The ways and means
have already been made available to study molecules on whose long,
recorded messages is written the autobiography of evolution—the history
of living organisms extending back to the beginnings of life. On this
same basis, it is now within the realm of science to foresee the means of
predicting the development of life from primordial, nonliving chemical
systems. Closely allied to the search for extraterrestrial life is research
which seeks to identify the materials and the conditions which are the
prerequisites of life.</p>
<p class="pnext">Space bioscience research is now extending human knowledge of fundamental
biological phenomena, both in space and on Earth, just as the
physical sciences explore other aspects of the universe. The accomplishment
of bioscience objectives is totally dependent upon advances in the
technology of space flight. A highly developed launch-vehicle capability
<span class="pageno target" title="3" id="page-3"> </span>is essential to accomplish the long-duration missions required in the
search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p class="pnext">Life on other planets in the solar system (with emphasis on Mars) will
be investigated by full exploitation of space technology which will allow
both remote (orbiter) and direct (lander) observations of the planetary
atmosphere, surface, and subsurface. Certain characteristics of terrestrial
life, such as growth and reproduction, provide a basis for relatively
simple experiments which may be used on early missions to detect the
existence of life on Mars. Later missions will provide extensive automatic
laboratory capabilities for analyzing many samples taken from
various depths and locations. Because of the hypothetical nature of
current experiment designs, it is likely that visual observations of the
planet will be required. Many technical problems are involved in storing
and transmitting the large amounts of data over planetary distances.
Such visual observations might very well be crucial in interpreting results
from other experiments. Critical to all exploration of the Moon and
planets are the requirements to: (1) prevent contamination of the
environment with Earth organisms and preserve the existing conditions
of the planet for biological exploration; (2) provide strict quarantine for
anything returned to Earth from the Moon and planets.</p>
<p class="pnext">The biological exploration of Mars is a scientific undertaking of the
greatest significance. Its realization will be a major milestone in the
history of human achievement. The characterization of life, if present,
and study of the evolutionary processes involved and their relationship
to the evolution of terrestrial life would have a great scientific and
philosophical impact. What is at stake is nothing less than knowledge
of our place in nature.</p>
<p class="pnext">Extended Earth orbital flights with subhuman specimens will be used
to determine the effects on Earth organisms of prolonged weightlessness,
radiation, and removal from the influence of the Earth's rotation. Such
flights of biosatellites and other suitable spacecraft are expected to:
(1) establish biological specifications for extending the duration of
manned space flight; (2) provide a flexible means of testing unforeseen
contingencies, thus providing an effective biological backup for manned
missions; (3) yield experimental data more rapidly by virtue of the
greater number and expendability of subjects; (4) anticipate possible delayed
effects appearing in later life or in subsequent generations, through
use of animal subjects with more rapid development and aging; (5) develop
and test new physiological instrumentation techniques, surgical
preparations, prophylactic techniques, and therapeutic procedures which
are not possible on human subjects; and (6) provide a broad background
of experience and data which will permit more accurate interpretations
of observed effects of space flight on living organisms, including man.

other than Earth presents an unequaled challenge in the history of
scientific search. Therefore, the detection of life within the solar system
is a major objective of space research in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="pnext">The scientific data presently available concerning the possible existence
of a Martian life form and the chemical constitution of the surface of
Mars are disappointingly few. In fact, it is impossible to make a statement
about any of the many surface features, other than the polar caps,
with any degree of certainty. The observational results have been
accounted for by many conflicting hypotheses which can only be resolved
by the accumulation of new evidence.</p>
<p class="pnext">The arguments supporting the existence of Martian life (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-1" id="id2">[ref.1]</a>) are
based on the following observations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">The various colors, including green, exhibited by the dark areas</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The seasonal changes in the visual albedo and polarization of the
dark areas</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The ability of the dark areas to regenerate after an extensive
"duststorm"</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The presence of absorption bands at 3.3µ-3.7µ, attributed to
organic molecules</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">Conflicting interpretations of the above observations have been advanced.
The argument based on the colors is inconclusive, and several
workers have suggested that the color is a contrast effect with the bright-reddish
continents. The meager quantitative data have been discussed
by Öpik (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-2" id="id3">[ref.2]</a>) who has reduced Kozyrev's photometric observations of
the very dark area of Syrtis Major to intrinsic reflectivities by allowing
for the estimated atmospheric attenuation and reflectivity. Kuiper (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-3" id="id4">[ref.3]</a>)
similarly demonstrated the absence of the near-infrared reflection
<span class="pageno target" title="6" id="page-6"> </span>maximum, which is characteristic of most green plants, indicating that
chlorophyll was not responsible for the color.</p>
<p class="pnext">The second and third arguments remain the most cogent. However,
serious limitations are imposed on the second if the severity of the
Martian climate is considered. Föcas (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-4" id="id5">[ref.4]</a>) has photometrically measured
the seasonal changes in the fine structure of the dark areas of Mars
and concludes that—</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">The dark areas of Mars show periodic variation of intensity following
the cycle of the darkening element</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The average intensity of the dark area, not including the action of
the darkening waves, increases from the poles toward the equator</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The action of each of the darkening waves decreases from the poles
toward the equator. This decrease is balanced in the equatorial
zone by the combined action of the two darkening waves alternately
originating at the two poles. The mechanism of the
darkness-generating element seems to be constant for all latitudes
during the Martian year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The variation in intensity has been explained recently by nonlife
mechanisms for Depressio Hellespontica (an area showing one of the
greatest seasonal changes) (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-2" id="id6">[ref.2]</a>). Similar nonlife mechanisms may be
applicable to the other dark regions, and, thus, the "darkening" can be
used only as circumstantial evidence in support of a Martian life form.</p>
<p class="pnext">If inorganic interpretations of the seasonal albedo variation are
accepted, then an inorganic interpretation must also be advanced for the
polarization variation. Two possibilities can be suggested:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">A change in surface texture, caused by varying absorption of atmospheric
constituents, causing both the albedo and polarization to
change in the manner observed</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">A change in surface texture, in which the surface material becomes
rougher, which also explains the observed polarization data
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-5" id="id7">[ref.5]</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The third argument against the regenerative feature of the dark areas
being a life process has been advanced by Kuiper (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-6" id="id8">[ref.6]</a>). It is based on
atmospheric circulation causing dust, presumably lava, to be blown on
the dark areas of Mars during the late summer, autumn, and winter, and
then removed during the spring. Mamikunian and Moore have recently
advanced the similar explanation that carbonaceous chondrites or
asteroidal matter may induce the observed phenomenon if they are
abundant on the planet's surface. The pulverized chondritic material
will exhibit a high degree of opacity due to localization and, hence, a
change in polarization characteristics and a decrease in polarization
<span class="pageno target" title="7" id="page-7"> </span>following mixing of the chondritic material with indigenous surface
minerals.</p>
<p class="pnext">The fourth observational argument, the Sinton bands (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-7" id="id9">[ref.7]</a>), has been
shown to be at least doubtful. Rea, Belsky, and Calvin (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-8" id="id10">[ref.8]</a>) recorded
infrared reflection spectra for a large number of inorganic and organic
samples, including minerals and biological specimens, for the purpose of
interpreting the 3µ-to-1µ spectrum of Mars. These authors state that a
previous suggestion that the Martian "bands" be attributed solely to
carbohydrates is not a required conclusion. At the same time they fail
to present a satisfactory alternate explanation, and the problem remains
unsolved. More recently, Rea et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-9" id="id11">[ref.9]</a>) noted the similarity between
the 3.58µ and 3.69µ minima in the Martian infrared spectra and those of
D<sub>2</sub>O-HDO-H<sub>2</sub>O mixtures and, particularly, of HDO.</p>
<p class="pnext">With all this marked disagreement in interpreting the observational
data concerning Mars, it becomes clearly evident that an experimental
approach to the detection of life on Mars should provide the maximum
positive information possible. Some life-detection experiments developed
with NASA support have been summarized by Quimby (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-10" id="id12">[ref.10]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">The schema of the biological exploration of a planet is to conduct a
series of complementary experiments proceeding from general to specific.
The general experiments will examine gross characteristics of the planet's
environment and surface for determining the probability of an active
biota (life). Data from the general experiments will be significant in—</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">Defining the nature of specific experiments in which life detection
is the major objective; and</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Providing a high degree of confidence in undertaking specific
experiments,
since indications from the gross characterization of the
planet in question will influence the choice and design of the
specific experiments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The biological exploration of planets is then to be defined as the search
for those parameters relevant to the origin, development, sustenance, and
degradation of life in a planetary environment. This definition will give
rise to a critical question for each progressively specific and complex
experiment to determine—</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">The existence of life on the planet</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The degree of similarity or dissimilarity (structure and function)
with respect to terrestrial life</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The origin of this planetary life</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The immediate objective of the biological explorations of the planet
is to define the state of the planetary surface, which may exhibit the
following properties:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">A prebiota (defined as the absence of life)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst"><span class="pageno target" title="8" id="page-8"> </span>An active biota (defined as the presence of life)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">An extinct biota (defined as evidence of former life)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The identification and the detailed characterization of each of the
above stages of planetary development constitute the subject matter of
the biological exploration of the planets and, specifically, Mars.</p>
<div class="level-3 section" id="the-experimental-investigation-of-chemical-evolution">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">THE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF CHEMICAL EVOLUTION</h3>
<p class="pfirst">Attempts have been made to simulate and approximate models of
primitive Earth conditions for abiogenic synthesis, and successful synthesis
of essential biochemical constituents necessary for maintaining life
has been partly accomplished.</p>
<p class="pnext">Urey (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-11" id="id13">[ref.11]</a>) has clearly pointed out the possible role of a reducing
atmosphere in the synthesis of prebiological organic molecules. Miller
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-12" id="id14">[ref.12]</a>) synthesized a variety of amino acids in a reducing atmosphere by
means of an electrical discharge. A variety of organic compounds have
been synthesized by the action of various energy sources upon reducing
atmospheres, and several investigators have extended the Urey-Miller-type
reactions to synthesize nucleic acid components (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-13" id="id15">[ref.13]</a>), adenosine
triphosphate (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-14" id="id16">[ref.14]</a>), and a host of biologically essential organic
compounds.</p>
<p class="pnext">It is likely that in the synthesis of organic moieties, simple and specific
molecules were first produced when the planets had a reducing atmosphere.
Further complexity or degradation of the organic compounds
produced varied, depending on the geochemical changes of the planet's
surface, the atmospheric constituents, the degree of interaction between
surface and atmosphere, and the rate of the organic synthesis. Oparin
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-15" id="id17">[ref.15]</a>) presented the most detailed mechanisms for the spontaneous
generation of the first living organism arising in a sea of organic compounds
synthesized in a reducing atmosphere on Earth.</p>
<p class="pnext">It is generally accepted that, under favorable conditions, life can arise
by spontaneous generation. A primary requirement for this initiation is
that there be abundant organic compounds concentrated in one or more
specific zones. These simple organic molecules would undergo modification
to develop a greater structural complexity and specificity, finally
giving rise to a "living" organism. Therefore, because of the ease with
which organic compounds can be synthesized under reducing conditions,
planetary surfaces may contain an abundant source of similar organic
matter. However, difficulties arise in postulating steps for further
organization or modification of the above synthesized organic matter
into a living state. Most of the original organic matter produced in the
primary reducing atmospheres of the various planets may have been
quite similar. However, major variations between planets, in chemical
<span class="pageno target" title="9" id="page-9"> </span>evolution beyond the prebiotic stage, must have been the rule rather
than the exception.</p>
<p class="pnext">The primary interest in this area of research has been the realization of
the possible existence of organic molecules on planetary surfaces and,
particularly, Mars. Pertinent synthesis may be either biological or
abiological. Research conducted in the simulation of cosmochemical
synthesis has used most of the available solar spectrum. Simulation
experiments devised to study the effects of these energies on the assumed
early atmosphere of the Earth have yielded products that play a dominant
role in molecular and biochemical organization of the cell.</p>
<p class="pnext">Calvin (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-16" id="id18">[ref.16]</a>) irradiated water and carbon dioxide in a cyclotron,
obtaining formaldehyde and formic acid. Miller (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-17" id="id19">[ref.17]</a>) found that
when methane, ammonia, water, and hydrogen were subjected to a high-frequency
electrical discharge, several amino acids were produced along
with a variety of other organic compounds.</p>
<p class="pnext">Corroborating experiments established that the synthesis of amino
acids occurred readily. The apparent mechanism for the production of
amino acids is as follows: aldehydes and hydrogen cyanide are synthesized
in the gas phase by the electrical discharge. These substances
react together and also together with ammonia in the water phase of the
system to give hydroxy and amino nitriles, which are then hydrolyzed to
hydroxy and amino acids. Among the major constituents were aspartic
acid, glutamic acid, glycine, α-alanine, and β-alanine.</p>
<p class="pnext">The "Miller-Urey" reaction mixture has been extended and several
modifications introduced. Oró (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-18" id="id20">[ref.18]</a>) introduced hydrogen cyanide
into the system as the primary gas component. Adenine was obtained
when Oró heated a concentrated solution of hydrogen cyanide in aqueous
ammonia for several days at temperatures up to 100° C. Adenine is an
essential component of nucleic acids and of several important coenzymes.
Guanine and urea were the two other products identified in the hydrogen
cyanide reaction. Oró further obtained guanine and uracil as products
of nonenzymatic reactions by using certain purine intermediates as
starting materials.</p>
<p class="pnext">Ponnamperuma (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-19" id="id21">[ref.19]</a>) also obtained adenine upon irradiation of
methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water, using a high-energy electron
beam as the source of energy of irradiation. These results indicate that
adenine is very readily synthesized under abiotic conditions. Adenine,
among the biologically important purines and pyrimidines, has the
greatest resonance energy, thus making its synthesis more likely and
imparting greater radiation stability to the molecule.</p>
<p class="pnext">The formation of adenine and guanine, the purines in RNA and
DNA, by a relatively simple abiological process lends further support
<span class="pageno target" title="10" id="page-10"> </span>to the hypothesis that essential biochemical constituents of life may have
originated on Earth by a gradual chemical evolution and selection. In
this respect, the examination of planetary surfaces—specifically Mars—presents
practical implications for current research on the problem of
chemical evolution.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Ponnamperuma et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-14" id="id22">[ref.14]</a>) exposed adenine and ribose to
ultraviolet light in the presence of phosphate, adenosine was produced.
When the adenine and ribose were similarly exposed in the presence of
the ethyl ester of polyphosphoric acid, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were produced. The abiological formation
of ATP was a major stride along the path of chemical evolution,
since ATP is the principal free energy source of living organisms.</p>
<p class="pnext">Oparin (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-15" id="id23">[ref.15]</a>) postulated that α-amino acids could have been formed
nonbiologically from hydrocarbons, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide at
a time when the Earth's atmosphere contained these substances in high
concentrations. Oparin's hypothesis has received strong experimental
support, as evidenced by the work of Miller (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-12" id="id24">[ref.12]</a>). Bernal (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-20" id="id25">[ref.20]</a>)
has emphasized the role played by ultraviolet light in the formation of
organic compounds at a certain stage of the Earth's evolution.</p>
<p class="pnext">Generally it has been believed that the first proteins or foreprotein
were nonbiologically formed by the polycondensation of preformed free
amino acids (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-21" id="id26">[ref.21]</a>). Akabori (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-22" id="id27">[ref.22]</a>) proposed a hypothesis for the
origin of the foreprotein and speculated that it must have been produced
through reactions consisting of the following three steps.</p>
<p class="pnext">The first step is the formation of aminoacetonitrile from formaldehyde,
ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">CH<sub>2</sub>O + NH<sub>3</sub> + HCN ————&gt; H<sub>2</sub>N—CH<sub>2</sub>—CN + H<sub>2</sub>O</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">The second is the polymerization of aminoacetonitrile on a solid surface,
probably absorbed on clay, followed by the hydrolysis of the polymer
to polyglycine and ammonia.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">x H<sub>2</sub>N—CH<sub>2</sub>—CN ————&gt; (—NH—CH<sub>2</sub>—C—)<sub>x</sub></div>

</div>
<div class="line" style="padding-left: 13em;">(—NH—CH<sub>2</sub>—CO—)<sub>x</sub> + x NH<sub>3</sub></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">The third step is the introduction of side chains into polyglycine by the
reaction with aldehydes or with unsaturated hydrocarbons. Akabori has
<span class="pageno target" title="11" id="page-11"> </span>demonstrated experimentally the formation of cystinyl and cysteinyl
residue in his above-postulated mechanism.</p>
<p class="pnext">Fox's theory of thermal copolymerization (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-23" id="id28">[ref.23]</a>) suggests that proteins
or like molecular units could have been formed in the Earth's crust,
under geothermal conditions. The accumulated amino acids were heat
polymerized and transported into the primary oceans for further modifications.
Fox has obtained polymers consisting of all 18 amino acids
usually present in proteins. The polymerization is generally done at
160° C to 200° C, although in the presence of polyphosphoric acid it can
be accomplished at temperatures below 100° C. Molecular weights
increased from 3600 in a proteinoid made at 160° C to 8600 in one made
at 190° C.</p>
<p class="pnext">Fox showed that when hot saturated solutions of thermal copolymers
containing the 18 common amino acids were allowed to cool, large
numbers of uniform, relatively firm, and elastic spherules separate.
These range from 0.2µ to 60µ in diameter and are quite uniform within
each preparation. Various chemical observations suggest the presence
of peptide bonds in the structural organization of these proteinoids.
Continuing observations of these microspheres have established further
characteristics that point to the possibility of their interpretation as a
kind of primitive protein macromolecule with self-organizing properties,
such that a primitive form of cell, with boundary and other properties,
might form.</p>
<p class="pnext">In laboratory experiments the behavior of gram-negative and gram-positive
microspheres in dilute alkali parallels that of gram-negative and
gram-positive bacteria (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-23" id="id29">[ref.23]</a>). Furthermore, time-lapse studies indicate
that the proteinoid microspheres undergo a septate kind of fission,
mimicking cell division as shown in figure 1. Cytochemical studies show
that the microsphere's boundary is membranelike in having a primitive
selectivity. Electron micrographs of sections of stained microspheres also
indicate the presence of a boundary.</p>
<p class="pnext">Oparin (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-15" id="id30">[ref.15]</a>) states that the type of organization peculiar to life
could only result from the evolution of a multimolecular organic system
separated from its environment by a distinct boundary but constantly
interacting with this environment. In his concept of coacervates as
precell models, Oparin (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-24" id="id31">[ref.24]</a>) indicates that present-day protoplasm
possesses a number of features similar to coacervate structure. These
coacervates could represent the starting point for evolution leading to
the origin of life. Moreover, in the course of their evolution the initial
systems may gradually become more complex. Oparin also showed (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-15" id="id32">[ref.15]</a>)
that mixing solutions of different proteins and other substances of
high molecular weight produced these coacervate droplets. These droplets
are characterized by the formation of a surface layer with altered
structure and mechanical properties, thus providing a somewhat selective
barrier in which to house a molecular system capable of replication.
However, these coacervates are unstable structurally.</p>

<p class="pfirst">With the essential biochemical constituents of life and the mechanism
of replication beginning to be understood, the challenge for the synthesis
of living matter by abiogenic experimental techniques has become to
many scientists the ultimate goal of the scientific era.</p>
<p class="pnext">NASA has established an exobiology laboratory at Ames Research
Center in addition to the sizable support of research at various academic
centers of excellence for the continuation of abiogenic synthesis.</p>
<p class="pnext">Although research on organochemical evolution is in its infancy, the
data from relatively few experiments have already created an immense
enthusiasm for knowledge of the biochemical pathways of evolution.
This kind of research will ultimately elucidate the terrestrial evolution
of life and, perhaps, the nature of life on other planetary bodies and the
distribution of life in our galaxy.</p>
<p class="pnext">This program, with its vast demands on the scientific community at

<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Meteorites</h4>
<p class="pfirst">A significant area of exobiological research is the investigation of a
special class of stony meteorites known as "carbonaceous chondrites." It
is increasingly apparent that almost all life-detection concepts rely on
the eventual analysis of the solid materials that may be available on Mars
and other planetary surfaces. Cosmic dust and meteorites are two classes
of material bodies that reach the Earth from outer space. The carbonaceous
chondrites are the only extraterrestrial materials known to
contain organic carbon.</p>
<p class="pnext">The study of meteorites has generated an astonishing diversity of
hypotheses. There is agreement at only one point: that meteorites are
preserved chunks of very ancient, perhaps primordial, planetary matter
and that when we are able to understand the curious structures and
chemical and isotopic variations in the meteorites, we will also know a
great deal about early planetary (and perhaps preplanetary) history.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="14" id="page-14"> </span>Meteorites provide a more representative sample of average planetary
matter than the highly differentiated crust of the Earth. Although it is
known that the meteorite parent bodies ceased to be geochemically active
shortly after their formation, some 4½ billion years ago, there is no consensus
on the nature of the meteorite parent bodies, not even on such
basic properties as size, location, and multiplicity. This is not surprising
because the meteorite samples commonly available for study represent
only about 10<sup>-23</sup> to 10<sup>-26</sup> of the parent body.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Most meteorites possess only traces of carbon, and studies of this carbon
indicate that it is composed largely of graphite, cohenite, and moissanite,
with some diamond. However, studies of the carbon in the carbonaceous
chondrites have failed to detect any of these forms. Some carbonates are
present in a minority of the carbonaceous group, but account for only
a small percentage of the total carbon (perhaps about 10 percent of the
total C in type I only).</p>
<p class="pnext">The carbonaceous chondrites contain organic carbon. The word
"organic" is not used in a biological sense, merely as a chemical term
to describe compounds of carbon other than carbonates, bicarbonates,
<span class="pageno target" title="15" id="page-15"> </span>and carbides. No evidence has been found of any form of carbon other
than organic, except for traces of carbonates.</p>
<p class="pnext">Various studies have demonstrated possible methods of estimating the
total amount of organic matter present in meteorites. Wiik (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-27" id="id35">[ref.27]</a>) has
suggested that organics can be estimated by measuring the loss of weight
on ignition. Unfortunately, this method has several disadvantages and
gives very low values. Corrections must be made for weight gains due
to oxidation of reduced constituents, such as FeO, Fe, Ni, and Co, and
for weight losses due to H<sub>2</sub>O, S, etc. The water loss is exceedingly difficult
to estimate, as part comes from the combustion of organic hydrogen and
part comes from the loss of mineral-bound water. The carbon also
proves difficult to combust completely, and high temperatures (over
1000° C) are required for efficient conversion to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="pnext">In one study the major fraction of organic matter removed proved to
have a carbon content of about 47 percent (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-28" id="id36">[ref.28]</a>). Thus, if all the
meteorite carbon is present as organic matter of approximately this
composition, total organics must be approximately double the carbon
content; that is, 2 percent by weight carbon indicates 4 percent by weight
organic matter. This estimate may be too low, for Mueller (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-29" id="id37">[ref.29]</a>) has
extracted a major organic fraction containing only 24 percent carbon;
however, this work has not been confirmed for other meteorites.</p>
<p class="pnext">Briggs and Mamikunian (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-26" id="id38">[ref.26]</a>) have pointed out that only 25 percent
of the organic matter has been extracted, and only about 5 percent of
this has been chemically characterized. Most of this 5 percent is a complex
mixture of hydroxylated aromatic acids together with hydrocarbons
of the aliphatic, napalicyclic, and aromatic series. Small amounts of
amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids are also present.</p>
<p class="pnext">Thus far, these chemical analyses point to an abiogenic origin for the
organic matter, and no conclusive evidence exists of biological activity
on the meteorite parent body. Microbiological investigations of samples
of the carbonaceous chondrites have yielded only inconclusive evidence
on the problem of "organized elements."</p>
<p class="pnext">Several of these microstructures from different carbonaceous chondrites
are illustrated in a paper by Mamikunian and Briggs (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-30" id="id39">[ref.30]</a>). It has
been difficult to identify the organized structures, and most do not have
morphologies identical to known terrestrial micro-organisms. However,
they may prove to be a variety of mineral grains, droplets of organic
matter and sulfur, as well as a small amount of contaminating terrestrial
debris.</p>
<p class="pnext">A comparison between the photographs of the organized elements
observed in the Orgueil and Ivuna meteorites and the synthetic proteinoid
microspheres observed by Fox (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-25" id="id40">[ref.25]</a>) point to similarities between the
<span class="pageno target" title="16" id="page-16"> </span>two. One inference from this finding is that the organized elements in
carbonaceous chondrites were never alive but, rather, should be considered
as natural experiments in molecular evolution. Also, these similarities
strengthen the belief that the laboratory experiments are similar
to the natural experiments in space.</p>
<p class="pnext">In cooperation with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,
NASA has a network to track meteors in the Midwest (South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois). Photographs
of meteor trails are used for scientific study, and attempts are
made to track and recover meteorites for examination for traces of
organic material of extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p class="pnext">Fundamental research in terrestrial organic geochemistry has shown
that ancient sediments and drill core samples subjected to organic
analysis contain certain stable biochemical components of past life. This
preserved record is significant not only in studies of early-life chemical
pathways but also in studies of the interaction of organic matter with
the geological factors. Since life on any planetary body will interact with
the soil, or surface material, it is of interest to understand the relationship.</p>

<div class="level-3 section" id="concepts-for-detection-of-extraterrestrial-life">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">CONCEPTS FOR DETECTION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE</h3>
<p class="pfirst">It is not possible to present completely convincing evidence for the
existence of extraterrestrial life. The problem often reduces to probabilities
and to estimates of observational reliability. In almost all cases
the evidence is optimistically considered strongly suggestive of—or, at
the worst, not inconsistent with—the existence of extraterrestrial life.
Alternatively, there is a pessimistic view that the evidence advanced for
extraterrestrial life is unconvincing, irrelevant, or has another, nonbiological
explanation.</p>
<p class="pnext">In studies of the laboratory synthesis of life-related compounds and its
significance concerning the origin of life, several results seem to suggest
that organochemical synthesis is a general process, occurring perhaps on
all planets which retain a reducing atmosphere. The temperature
ranges must be such that precursors and reaction products are not
thermally dissociated. The reaction rates for the synthesis of more complex
organic molecules diminish to a negligible value when the temperature
range is below 100° C.</p>
<p class="pnext">Besides the planetary parameter of temperature, an even more fundamental
necessity for a living state exists—a liquid solvent system. For
terrestrial life forms, water serves this purpose. Water has this and
other properties of biological significance because of hydrogen bonding
between adjacent molecules in the liquid state.</p>
<p class="pnext">Ultraviolet radiation could serve as an extraterrestrial energy source
<span class="pageno target" title="17" id="page-17"> </span>for organic synthesis. Research shows that, while an atmosphere is
important, living systems can survive a wide range of ambient pressures
and are little affected by a wide range of magnetic field strengths.</p>
<p class="pnext">Oxygen is not a prerequisite for all living systems. While it is sometimes
concluded that free oxygen is needed for all but the simplest
organisms, less efficient metabolic processes coupled with higher food
collection efficiency—or a more sluggish metabolism—would seem to do
just as well. Earth is the only planet in the solar system on which
molecular oxygen is known to be present in large amounts. Since plant
photosynthesis is the primary source of atmospheric oxygen, it seems
safe to infer that no other planet has large-scale plant photosynthesis
accompanied by the production of oxygen.</p>
<p class="pnext">The possibility of the existence of extraterrestrial life raises the
important question of man's being able to detect it. Research on extraterrestrial
life detection is predicated on the ability to develop ways to
detect it even when the living systems are based on principles entirely
different from those on Earth.</p>
<p class="pnext">The substitution of various molecules for those of known biological
significance to living organisms as we know them has been investigated;
the substitution of NH<sub>2</sub> for OH in ammonia-rich environments leads to
a diverse, and biologically very promising, chemistry. The hypothesis
that silicon may replace carbon does not support the construction of
extraterrestrial genetics based on silicon compounds. (Silicon compounds
participate in redistribution reactions which tend to maximize
the randomness of silicon bonding, and the stable retention of genetic
information over long time periods is thus very improbable.)</p>
<p class="pnext">Evidence relevant to life on Mars has been summarized by Sagan

<div class="line"><em class="italics">The Origin of Life</em></div>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">In the past decade, considerable advances have been made in our knowledge of the
probable processes leading to the origin of life on Earth. A succession of laboratory
experiments has shown that essentially all the organic building blocks of contemporary
terrestrial organisms can be synthesized by supplying energy to a mixture of
the hydrogen-rich gases of the primitive terrestrial atmosphere. It now seems likely
that the laboratory synthesis of a self-replicating molecular system is only a short time
away from realization. The syntheses of similar systems in the primitive terrestrial
oceans must have occurred—collections of molecules which were so constructed that,
by the laws of physics and chemistry, they forced the production of identical copies
of themselves out of the building blocks in the surrounding medium. Such a system
satisfies many of the criteria for Darwinian natural selection, and the long evolutionary
path from molecule to advanced organism can then be understood. Since nothing
except very general primitive atmospheric conditions and energy sources are required
for such syntheses, it is possible that similar events occurred in the early history of
Mars and that life may have come into being on that planet several billions of years
<span class="pageno target" title="18" id="page-18"> </span>ago. Its subsequent evolution, in response to the changing Martian environment,
would have produced organisms quite different from those which now inhabit Earth.</p>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><em class="italics">Simulation Experiments</em></div>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Experiments have been performed in which terrestrial micro-organisms have been
introduced into simulated Martian environments, with atmospheres composed of nitrogen
and carbon dioxide, no oxygen, very little water, a daily temperature variation
from +20° to -60° C, and high ultraviolet fluxes. It was found that in every sample
of terrestrial soil used there were a few varieties of micro-organisms which easily survived
on "Mars." When the local abundance of water was increased, terrestrial micro-organisms
were able to grow. Indigenous Martian organisms may be even more efficient
in coping with the apparent rigors of their environment. These findings underscore
the necessity for sterilizing Mars entry vehicles so as not to perform accidental biological
contamination of that planet and obscure the subsequent search for extraterrestrial
life.</p>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><em class="italics">Direct Searches for Life on Mars</em></div>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">The early evidence for life on Mars—namely, reports of vivid green coloration and
the so-called "canals"—are now known to be largely illusory. There are three major
areas of contemporary investigation: visual, polarimetric, and spectrographic.</p>
<p class="pnext">As the Martian polar ice cap recedes each spring, a wave of darkening propagates
through the Martian dark areas, sharpening their outlines and increasing their contrast
with the surrounding deserts. These changes occur during periods of relatively high
humidity and relatively high daytime temperatures. A related dark collar, not due to
simple dampening of the soil, follows the edge of the polar cap in its regression. Occasional
nonseasonal changes in the form of the Martian dark regions have been observed
and sometimes cover vast areas of surface.</p>
<p class="pnext">Observations of the polarization of sunlight reflected from the Martian dark areas
indicate that the small particles covering the dark areas change their size distribution
in the spring, while the particles covering the bright areas <em class="italics">do</em> not show any analogous
changes.</p>
<p class="pnext">Finally, infrared spectroscopic observations of the Martian dark areas show three
spectral features which, to date, seem to be interpretable only in terms of organic matter,
the particular molecules giving rise to the absorptions being hydrocarbons and
aldehydes. [However, see p. 7 and Rea et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-9" id="id42">[ref.9]</a>).]</p>
<p class="pnext">Taken together, these observations suggest, but do not conclusively prove, that the
Martian dark areas are covered with small organisms composed of familiar types of
organic matter, which change their size and darkness in response to the moisture and
heat of the Martian spring. We have no evidence either for or against the existence
of more advanced life forms. There is much more information which <em class="italics">can</em> be garnered
from the ground, balloons, Earth satellites, Mars flybys, and Mars orbiters, but the
critical tests for life on Mars can only be made from landing vehicles equipped with
experimental packages....</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">Results of Kaplan et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-31" id="id43">[ref.31]</a>) indicate that Mars has no detectable
oxygen, but does contain small amounts of water vapor, more abundant
carbon dioxide, possibly a large surface flux of solar ultraviolet radiation,
and estimated daily temperature variations of 100° C at many latitudes.
Studies have shown that terrestrial micro-organisms can survive these
extremely harsh environments. Furthermore, a variety of physiological
<span class="pageno target" title="19" id="page-19"> </span>and ecological adaptations might enable the biota to survive the low
nighttime temperatures and intracellular ice crystallization.</p>
<p class="pnext">Less evidence is available to support the possibility of extraterrestrial
life on other planets. The Moon has no atmosphere, and extremes of
temperature characterize its surface. However, the Moon could have
a layer of subsurface permafrost beneath which liquid water might be
trapped. The temperatures of these strata might be biologically moderate.</p>
<p class="pnext">Studies by Davis and Libby (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-32" id="id44">[ref.32]</a>) on the atmosphere of Jupiter
support the possibility of the production of organic matter in its atmosphere
in a manner analogous to the processes which may have led to the
synthesis of organic molecules in the Earth's early history. It is difficult
to assess the possibility that life has evolved on Jupiter during the
4- or 5-billion-year period in which the planet has retained a reducing
atmosphere.</p>
<p class="pnext">The question of extraterrestrial life and of the origin of life is interwoven.
Discovery of the first and analysis of its nature may very well
elucidate the second.</p>
<p class="pnext">The oldest form of fossil known today is that of a microscopic plant
similar in form to common algae found in ponds and lakes. Scientists
know that similar organisms flourished in the ancient seas over 2 billion
years ago. However, since algae are a relatively complex form of life,
life in some simpler form could have originated much earlier. Organic
material similar to that found in modern organisms can be detected in
these ancient deposits as well as in much older Precambrian rocks.</p>
<p class="pnext">Although the planets now have differing atmospheres, in their early
stages the atmospheres of all the planets may have been essentially the
same. The most widely held theory of the origin of the solar system states
that the planets were formed from vast clouds of material containing the
elements in their cosmic distribution.</p>
<p class="pnext">It is believed that the synthesis of organic compounds preceding the
origin of life on Earth occurred before its atmosphere was transformed
from hydrogen and hydrides to oxygen and nitrogen. This theory is
supported by laboratory experiments of Calvin (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-16" id="id45">[ref.16]</a>), Miller (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-33" id="id46">[ref.33]</a>),
and Oró (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-34" id="id47">[ref.34]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">The Earth's present atmosphere consists of nitrogen and oxygen in
addition to relatively small amounts of other gases; most of the oxygen
is of biological origin. Some of the atmospheric gases, in spite of their low
amounts, are crucial for life. The ultraviolet-absorbing ozone in the
upper atmosphere and carbon dioxide are examples of such gases.</p>
<p class="pnext">Significant in the search for extraterrestrial life are the data (e.g.,
planet's temperature) transmitted by Mariner II, which was launched
from Cape Canaveral on August 27, 1962, and flew past Venus on
<span class="pageno target" title="20" id="page-20"> </span>December 14, 1962. Mariner II's measurements showed temperatures on
the surface of Venus of the order of 800° F, too hot for life as known
on Earth.</p>
<p class="pnext">The question "Is life limited to this planet?" can be considered on a
statistical basis. Although the size of the sample (one planet) is small,
the statistical argument for life elsewhere is believed by many to be very
strong. While Mars is generally considered the only other likely habitat
of life in our solar system, Shapley (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-35" id="id48">[ref.35]</a>) has calculated that more than
100 million stars have planets sufficiently similar in composition and
environment to Earth to support life. Of course, yet unknown factors
may significantly reduce or even eliminate this probability.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="spacecraft-sterilization">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">SPACECRAFT STERILIZATION</h3>
<p class="pfirst">The search for extraterrestrial life with unmanned space probes
requires the total sterilization of the landing capsule and its contents.
Scientists agree that terrestrial organisms released on other planets would
interfere with exobiological explorations (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-36" id="id49">[ref.36]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-43" id="id50">[ref.43]</a>). Any flight that
infects a planet with terrestrial life will compromise a scientific opportunity
of almost unequaled proportions. Studies on microbiological
survival in simulated deep-space conditions (low temperature, high
ultraviolet flux, and low dose levels of ionizing radiation) indicate that
these conditions will not sterilize contaminated spacecraft (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-44" id="id51">[ref.44]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-48" id="id52">[ref.48]</a>).
Furthermore, many terrestrial sporeformers and some vegetative bacteria,
especially those with anaerobic growth capabilities, readily survive in
simulated Martian environments (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-49" id="id53">[ref.49]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-54" id="id54">[ref.54]</a>). It has been estimated
that a single micro-organism with a replication time of 30 days could, in
8 years of such replication, equal in number the bacterial population
of the Earth. This potential could result not only in competition with
any Martian life, but in drastic changes in the geochemical and atmospheric
characteristics of the planet. To avoid such a disaster, certainly
the first, and probably many succeeding landers on Mars, must be sterile—devoid
of terrestrial life (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-55" id="id55">[ref.55]</a>). Since the space environment will not
in itself kill all life aboard, the lander must leave the Earth in a sterile
condition.</p>
<p class="pnext">The sterility of an object implies the complete absence of life. The
presence of life or the lack of sterility may be proven; but the absence of
life or sterility cannot be proven, for the one viable organism that
negates sterility may remain undetected. Many industrial products
which must be guaranteed as sterile cannot be tested for sterility in a
nondestructive manner. A similar situation exists in determining the
sterility of a spacecraft. Certification of sterility—based on experience
with the sterilizing process used, knowledge of the kinetics of the death
<span class="pageno target" title="21" id="page-21"> </span>of micro-organisms, and computation of the probability of a survivor
from assays for sterility—is the only accurate approach to defining the
sterility of such treated items.</p>
<p class="pnext">Macroscopic life can be readily detected and kept from or removed
from the spacecraft, but the detection and removal of microscopic and
submicroscopic life is an extremely difficult task. The destruction of
micro-organisms can be achieved by various chemical and physical procedures.
Sterilizing agents have been evaluated not only for their ability
to kill microbial life on surfaces and sealed inside components, but also
for the agents' effects on spacecraft reliability as well (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-56" id="id56">[ref.56]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-59" id="id57">[ref.59]</a>). Of
the available agents, only heat and radiation will penetrate solid materials.
Radiation is expensive, hazardous, difficult to control, and
apparently damages more materials than does heat. Heat, therefore, has
been selected as the primary method of spacecraft sterilization and will
be used, except in specific instances where radiation may prove to be less
detrimental to the reliability of critical parts (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-60" id="id58">[ref.60]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">The sterilization of spacecraft is a difficult problem if flight reliability
is not to be impaired. The development of heat-resistant parts will
enable the design and manufacture of a heat-sterilizable spacecraft.
Without careful microbiological monitoring of manufacture and assembly
procedures, many bacteria could be trapped in parts and subassemblies.
To permit sterilization at the lowest temperature-time regimen
that will insure kill of all organisms, the microbiological load inside
all parts and subassemblies must be held to a minimum.</p>
<p class="pnext">The role of industrial clean rooms in reducing the biological load on
spacecraft is currently being defined. NASA-supported studies indicate
that biological contamination in industrial clean rooms for extended
time periods is about 1 logarithm less (tenfold reduction), compared
with conditions in a well-operated microbiological laboratory (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-61" id="id59">[ref.61]</a>).
With the use of clean-room techniques and periodic decontamination by
low heat cycles or ethylene oxide treatment, it should be possible to bring
a spacecraft to the point of sterilization with about 10<sup>6</sup> organisms on
board (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-60" id="id60">[ref.60]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">The sterilization goal established for Mars landers is a probability of
less than 1 in 10 000 (10<sup>-4</sup>) that a single viable organism will be present
on the spacecraft. Laboratory studies of the kinetics of dry-heat
kill of resistant organisms show that at 135° C the number of bacterial
spores can be reduced 1 logarithm (90 percent) for every 2 hours of
exposure (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-58" id="id61">[ref.58]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-62" id="id62">[ref.62]</a>). The reduction in microbial count needed
is the logarithm of the maximum number on the spacecraft (10<sup>6</sup>) plus the
logarithm of the reciprocal of the probability of a survivor (10<sup>4</sup>), or a
total of 10 logarithms of reduction in microbial count. Thus, with an
<span class="pageno target" title="22" id="page-22"> </span>additional 2 logarithms added as a safety factor, a total of 12 logarithms
of reduction in count has been accepted as a safe value which can be
achieved by a dry-heat treatment of 135° C for 24 hours. This is the heat
cycle that is currently under study and being developed for use in spacecraft
sterilization (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-60" id="id63">[ref.60]</a>). However, other heat treatments at temperatures
as low as 105° C for periods of 300 hours or longer are under study
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-63" id="id64">[ref.63]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">Based on results to date, it is reasonable to believe that a full complement
of heat-sterilizable hardware will be available when needed for
planetary exploration. Every effort is being made to improve the state
of the art to a point where spacecraft can not only withstand sterilization
temperatures, but will be even more reliable than the present state-of-the-art
hardware that is not heated.</p>

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF WEIGHTLESSNESS AND ZERO GRAVITY</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">H</span><span class="dropspan small-caps">igh priority has been given to studies of weightlessness.</span> Gravity
is one of the most fundamental forces that acts on living organisms,
and all life on Earth except the smallest appears to be oriented with
respect to gravity, although certain organisms are more responsive to it
than others. The gravity force on Earth is 1 g, but this force may be
experimentally varied from zero g, or weightlessness, to many thousands
of g's.</p>
<p class="pnext">Zero gravity or decreased gravity occurs during freefall, in parabolic
trajectory, or during orbit around the Earth. Gravitational force
decreases by the square of the distance away from the Earth's center. It is
reduced about 5 percent at about 200 nautical miles' altitude. Gravitational
force greater than 1 g can be obtained by acceleration, deceleration,
or impact. It also can be increased by using a centrifuge which adds a
radial acceleration vector to the 1 g of Earth.</p>
<p class="pnext">On the ground, the biological effects of gravity have been studied at
1 g, and experimentally, forces of many g have been produced. In addition,
modifications of the effects of the 1-g force have been induced by
suspension of the organism in water or by horizontal immobilization of
an erect animal such as man. The biological effects of such modification
have been of significant value in understanding some of the possible
consequences of human exposure to the zero-g environment of space.</p>
<p class="pnext">Weightlessness in an Earth-orbiting satellite occurs when the continuous
acceleration of Earth's gravity is exactly counterbalanced by the
continuous radial acceleration of the satellite. In such a weightless
state, organisms are liberated from their natural and continuous exertion
against 1 g, but this liberation may carry with it certain serious physical
penalties.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="24" id="page-24"> </span>Some of the physical processes which probably have the greatest biological
effects are (1) convective flow of fluid, e.g., protoplasmic streaming,
transport of nutrient materials, oxygen, waste products, and CO<sub>2</sub>
from the immediate environment of the cell, and (2) sedimentation
occurring within cells; substances of higher density sediment in a gravitational
field, and those of lighter density rise. A separation of particles of
different densities probably occurs. The removal of gravity would
change a distribution of particles like mitochondria by 10 percent (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-64" id="id65">[ref.64]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">Gravity has effects on the physical processes involved in mitosis and
meiosis. Study under weightlessness might contribute to our understanding
of the general cellular information-relay process.</p>
<p class="pnext">A gravitational effect is known in the embryonic development of the
frog <em class="italics">Rana sylvatica</em>. After fertilization, the eggs rotate in the gravitational
field so that the black animal hemisphere is uppermost. Development
becomes abnormal if this position is disturbed. If the egg is
inverted following the first cleavage and held in this position, two abnormal
animals result, united like Siamese twins. This phenomenon appears
to be related to the gravitational separation of low- and high-density
components of the egg. The size of the egg is about 1 to 2 mm and is
suspended in water of about the same density. This system is very
sensitive to gravity; and, under weightlessness, the separation of different
density components might be irregular, leading to aberrant development.
When certain aquatic insect eggs are inverted, subsequent development
results in shortened abnormal larvae.</p>
<p class="pnext">The directional growth of plant shoots and plant roots is probably due
to this sedimentation phenomenon, particularly the effect on movement
of auxins (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-65" id="id66">[ref.65]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">Free convection flow is a major transport process, and under its
influence the mixing of substances is much more effective than when
diffusion operates alone. Free convection flow is a macroscopic phenomenon
which increases not only with g, but varies also approximately
with the five-fourths power of the bulk concentration involved. Whether
or not convection is important at the microscopic level remains an experimentally
unsolved question. The Grashoff number limits free convection
to the macroscopic domain. It would appear in weightlessness that
the contribution of free convective flow would be small and that only
diffusion should occur. This phenomenon would cause equilibration to
occur much more slowly than that occurring with free convection and
diffusion. The absence of convective transfer raises a problem as to how
nutrients may be obtained and waste products removed in living cells
during weightlessness. In a liquid substrate, nutrients and oxygen would
be depleted, and waste products would accumulate around the cell.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="25" id="page-25"> </span>Absence of gravity may have far-reaching consequences in the homeostatic
aspects of cell physiology. The outstanding characteristics of living
cells which are most likely to be influenced by the absence of gravity are
the ability of the cell to maintain its cytoplasmic membrane in a functional
state, the capacity of the cell to perform its normal functions
during the mitotic cycle, and the capacity of the cytoplasm to maintain
the constant reversibility of its sol-gel system (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-66" id="id67">[ref.66]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">Two-phase systems, e.g., air-in-water and air-in-oil, possess entirely
different characteristics at zero g than at 1 g. These physical differences
in phase interaction could well be suspected of interfering with the
orientation and flow pattern of cell constituents, thus hindering the
cellular processes involved in the movement, metabolism, and storage of
nutrients and waste.</p>
<p class="pnext">On the basis of theoretical calculations, weightlessness can be expected
to have some effect even on one individual cell if its size exceeds 10
microns in diameter (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-64" id="id68">[ref.64]</a>). Cell colonies might be affected. In larger
cells there may be a redistribution of enzyme-forming systems which give
rise to polarization. The low surface tension of the cell membrane lends
itself to hydrostatic stress distortion, implying an alteration in permeability
and thus an almost certain alteration of cell properties under low
gravity conditions.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another aspect of gravity that affects the growth and development of
living organisms is the directionality of the gravitational field. In fact,
some plants are so sensitive that they are able to direct their growth
with as little stimulus as a 1×10<sup>-6</sup> gravitational field. Investigations of
plant growth in altered gravitational fields are underway at Argonne
National Laboratory and Dartmouth College.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Argonne Laboratory has designed and developed a 4-pi, or
omnidirectional, clinostat. By rotating a plant so that the force of
gravity is distributed evenly over all possible directions, the directional
effects of gravity are eliminated, simulating some aspects of the zero-g
state. It was shown that certain plants grew more slowly and had fewer
and smaller leaves, while others had about 25 percent greater replication
of fronds and had greater elongation of certain plant parts. It will be
extremely interesting to compare these effects under zero-g conditions
in orbiting spacecraft.</p>
<p class="pnext">The effect of gravity in transporting growth hormones in plants has
been demonstrated at Dartmouth College using radiocarbon-labeled
growth hormones. Plant geotropisms and growth movements have been
studied and biosatellite experiments developed.</p>
<p class="pnext">Anatomy is considered a derivative adaptation to gravity (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-67" id="id69">[ref.67]</a>). A
large background of plant research exists on the effect of orientation on
<span class="pageno target" title="26" id="page-26"> </span>plant responses. Information from clinostat experiments is considered
susceptible of extrapolation to low gravity conditions because the
threshold period for gravitational triggering is relatively long.</p>
<p class="pnext">Once over critical minimum dimensions, the major effects of low
gravity would be assumed to occur in those heterocellular organisms that
develop in more or less fixed orientation with respect to terrestrial gravity
and which respond to changes in orientation with relatively long induction
periods; these are the higher plant orders. On the other extreme
are the complex primates which respond rapidly, but whose multiplicity
of organs and correlative mechanisms are susceptible to malfunction
and disorganization. It may be suggested that the heterocellular lower
plants and invertebrates will be less affected. Perturbations of the
environment to which the experimental organism is exposed must be
limited or controlled to reduce uncertainties in interpretation of the
results. At the same time, the introduction of known perturbations may
assist in isolating the effects due solely to gravity. Study of <em class="italics">de novo</em>
differentiation and other phenomena immediately after syngamy may be
of particular importance. Study of anatomical changes after exposure
of the organism to low gravity is important.</p>

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SPACE RADIATION<a class="footnote-reference pginternal" href="#id71" id="id70"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
<p class="pfirst">Radiation sources in space are of three types: galactic cosmic radiation,
Van Allen belts, and solar flares with an intense proton flux. Cosmic
radiation has higher energy levels than radiation produced by manmade
accelerators.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Panel on Radiation Biology, while recognizing the need for
radiobiological studies of an applied nature with reference to manned
flight programs, stated that it would be shortsighted for the United States
to confine its efforts to the solution of immediate problems since, in the
long run, successful exploration of space will be aided by the contributions
of basic research. Both the immediate biological research program
and the continuing program for basic studies should be built upon the
large body of existing knowledge of radiation effects. The attitude that
all radiobiological experiments need be repeated in the space environment
should be resolutely rejected. Since fundamental radiobiology
cannot be performed easily in space, it has been recommended that,
wherever possible, these investigations be carried out in ground laboratories
in preference to flying laboratories.</p>
<p class="pnext">Space environment does vary from the terrestrial environment, but
the variations are not so great as to lead to the expectation of strikingly
<span class="pageno target" title="27" id="page-27"> </span>different biological effects of radiation in space. However, it is conceivable
that radiations whose effects are well known under terrestrial
conditions may have some unsuspected biological effects when combined
with unusual features of the space environment: e.g., zero g. Previous
space radiobiological studies have depended solely on very low and
inaccurately measured doses of ambient space radiation. It has been
difficult to distinguish between the observed response levels and the
random noise; thus, experiments have been inconclusive.</p>
<div class="level-4 section" id="biological-effects-of-heavy-ions-and-mesons">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Biological Effects of Heavy Ions and Mesons</h4>
<p class="pfirst">The biological effects of heavy ions (especially Z&gt;2) and mesons are
of specific interest to space radiobiology.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="controlled-radiobiological-experiments-in-space">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Controlled Radiobiological Experiments in Space</h4>
<p class="pfirst">There is the remote possibility that the radiobiological response may
be modified by factors as yet unknown and perhaps not susceptible to
terrestrial study. Experiments have been designed to settle this matter
including the exposure of biological materials during space flight which
meet the following criteria of reliability: (1) the use of well-known
biological systems, e.g., mutation induction or chromosome breakage;
(2) the use of a sufficient number of individuals in the experiment to
guarantee statistical precision on the results; (3) the exposure of the
system to known quantities and qualities of radiation; (4) the use of
adequate controls.</p>
<p class="pnext">High-altitude balloon ascents of the 1930's initiated study of the
biological effects of cosmic rays. They were limited to the exploration
of secondary cosmic radiation effects. After World War II, the research
extended to the use of V-2 rockets fired from the White Sands Proving
Ground. Interest returned to balloons and a significant program was
underway by 1950, first using mice and then hamsters, fruit flies, cats,
and dogs. These flights gave no evidence of radiation damage. However,
it was realized that the flights were too far south to obtain a significant
exposure, and more northerly flights began in 1953. Mice and
guinea pigs were flown on these later flights. Chase (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-68" id="id72">[ref.68]</a>) showed the
most unequivocal results to that time, a statistically significant increase
in light hairs on black animals and the streaks of white hair up to 10
times wider than expected. Brain lesions were detected in the guinea
pigs flown on Man High in 1957. Many other types of biological material
were sent aloft in an effort to further corroborate existing information
and to investigate genetic and developmental effects of cosmic radiation.</p>
<p class="pnext">From the earlier V-2 rocket flights to the Jupiter missile launchings of
the monkeys Able and Baker, cosmic-ray research was continued, but the
<span class="pageno target" title="28" id="page-28"> </span>short flight durations of these vehicles did not provide substantial information.
The USAF Discoverer satellite program has given impetus to
cosmic-ray research and provided for longer "staytimes."</p>
<p class="pnext">It has been difficult to separate radiation effects from other space-flight
factors: therefore, some of the alterations observed are still subject to
debate. Vibration, acceleration, and weightlessness appear to be the
three most important additional parameters. Measurements of radiation
dosage have been made by chemical and photographic dosimetry, ion
chambers, and biological dosimetry. All evidence to date indicates that
radiation exposure levels are not hazardous to man at present orbital
altitudes up to 200 nautical miles. Most biological materials flown so far
have been for the express purpose of investigating space-radiation levels
and effects. The biological materials have ranged from tissue cultures
to entire organisms and from phage and bacterial cells to man. The
studies have required much of the space and weight resources allotted
biology by the U.S.S.R. and the United States. They have been accompanied
by ground-based controls.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Vostok series provided the following data:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">A small, but statistically significant, increase was observed in the
percentage of chromosome aberrations in the rootlet cells of
air-dried wheat and pea seeds after germination. In this case
only, the increase did not depend on flight duration.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Lysogenic bacteria exhibited an increase of genetic alterations and
increased phage production. Length of flight was associated
with increased bacteriophage production by the lysogenic bacteria.
There was an increase of recessive lethals coupled with
nonconvergence of chromosomes (sex linked) in the fruit fly. A
stimulation of cell division in wheat and pea seeds was observed.
Cultures of human cells exposed to space-flight factors did not
differ significantly from terrestrial controls with respect to such
indicators as proliferation rate, percentage of mortality and
morphological, antigenic, and cultural properties. Repeated
flights of the identical HeLa cells revealed that there was a
longer latent period for restoration of growth capacity than in
cells carried into space once or not flown at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The most definite radiation effects observed were only revealed in
genetic tests. No harmful influence on those characteristics
affecting the viability of the organism has been discovered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The Air Force Discoverer series launched from the west coast had a
few successful flights incorporating organisms. With severe environmental
stress and long recovery times, data on radiation exposure were
equivocal up to Discoverer XVII and XVIII when cultures of human
<span class="pageno target" title="29" id="page-29"> </span>tissue were flown, recovered, and assessed for radiation exposure effects.
Comparison with ground-based controls revealed no measurable
differences.</p>
<p class="pnext">Radiation dosimetry from the Mercury series established that minimal
exposures were encountered at those orbital altitudes. A typical example
is the MA-8 flight of W. M. Schirra, Jr., during which the body surface
dosage was less than 30 millirads.</p>
<p class="pnext">NASA has supported fundamental radiation studies at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. Emphasis
has been placed on the biological effects of high-energy proton radiation
and particulate radiation from accelerators.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the NASA Ames Research Center extensive fundamental studies
are being carried out on the effects of radiation, especially in the nervous
system. It has been demonstrated that deposits accumulate in the brain
following exposure to large doses of ionizing particle radiation as well
as after X-irradiation. These deposits, referred to as a "chemical lesion,"
result from an accumulation of glycogen. The formation of these
deposits during exposure to large doses of X-irradiation was not increased
in environments of 99.5 percent oxygen and increased atmospheric
pressure.</p>

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">SIMULATION OF PLANETARY (MARTIAN) ENVIRONMENTS</h3>
<p class="pfirst">Attempts have been made to simulate to some degree the various
parameters of the Martian environment, such as atmospheric composition,
pressure, radiation flux, temperatures, and the day-night as well as
seasonal cycles. Certain factors for Mars cannot yet be simulated, such
as soil composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and electrical field.</p>
<p class="pnext">Caution is required in interpreting all simulation experiments. How
Earth organisms respond to simulated Martian environments probably
has nothing to do with life on Mars, but these experiments may show
whether or not anything in the environment of Mars makes life as we
know it impossible. We must expect that on Mars, life will have evolved
and have adapted over long periods of time under conditions which are
quite different from conditions on Earth. The simulation experiments
also provide some information about the possibility of contaminating
the planet Mars, or any planet, with organisms from Earth. In addition,
they give us some clues about the possibilities of adaptation and evolution
of life under these conditions.</p>
<p class="pnext">From an evolutionary point of view, if life has developed on Mars, we
expect it to have evolved at least to a microbial stage. On Earth, micro-organisms
are the most ubiquitous and numerous forms of life. This
fact should be considered in studying extraterrestrial bodies.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="30" id="page-30"> </span>Micro-organisms have been selected as the best test organisms, and
bacteria and fungi have been used because they are durable and easy to
grow. Also, because of their rapid growth, many generations can be
studied in a relatively short period of time. The organisms include
chemoautotrophic bacteria, which are able to synthesize their cell constituents
from carbon dioxide by energy derived from inorganic reactions;
anaerobic bacteria, which grow only in the absence of molecular
oxygen; photoautotrophic plants such as algae, lichens, and more complex
seed plants; and small terrestrial animals.</p>
<p class="pnext">Organisms have been collected from tundra, desert, hot springs, alpine,
and saline habitats to obtain species with specialized capabilities to conserve
water, balance osmotic discrepancies, store gases, accommodate to
temperature extremes, and otherwise meet stresses. An attempt is made
in these simulation experiments to extend these processes across the
possible overlapping microenvironments which Earth and Mars may
share.</p>
<p class="pnext">Scientists have developed various special environmental simulators,
including "Mars jars" and "Marsariums." These have made possible
controlled temperatures, atmospheres, pressures, water activities, and
soil conditions for duplicating assumed Martian surface. A complex
simulator, developed by Young et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-52" id="id73">[ref.52]</a>), reproduces the formation
of a permafrost layer with some water tied up in the form of ice beneath
the soil surface. This simulator serves as a model to study the wave of
darkening, thus supporting the hypothesis that the pole-to-equator
wave of darkening is correlated with the availability of subsurface water.
The simulator is a heavily insulated 2-cu-ft capacity chamber with an
internal pressure of 0.1 atm. The chamber contains a soil mixture of
limonite and sand and an atmosphere of carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
With the use of a liquid nitrogen heat exchanger at one end and an
external battery of infrared lamps at the other end, the temperature simulates
that of Mars from pole to equator. Thermocouples throughout
the soil monitor the temperatures in the chamber.</p>
<p class="pnext">Zhukova and Kondratyev (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-69" id="id74">[ref.69]</a>) designed a structure measuring
100×150×180 cm. Micro-organisms were placed at the surface of a
copper bar made in a special groove separated by glass cloth. Copper
was selected as one of the best heat-conduction materials permitting a
rapid change of temperature. The lower end of the bar was immersed
into a mixture of dry ice and ethyl alcohol, which made it possible to
create a temperature of -60° C. Heating was performed by an incandescent
spiral.</p>
<p class="pnext">As the knowledge concerning the Martian environment becomes more
refined, scientists can more accurately simulate this environment under
<span class="pageno target" title="31" id="page-31"> </span>controlled conditions in the laboratory. Determination of the effects of
the Martian environment on Earth organisms will permit better theorization
on the forms of life we might find on Mars and will permit us to
estimate the potential survival of Earth contaminants on Mars.</p>
<p class="pnext">However, until the environmental conditions of Mars are defined
more accurately, the experiments must be changed continually to fit
newly determined conditions. Therefore, existing simulation data are
made less valid for comparison. The data resulting from the simulation
experiments for Mars have been compiled in <a class="reference internal pginternal" href="#table-ii">table II</a>, and the experiments
are summarized below.</p>
<p class="pnext">The earliest simulation studies were carried out by the Air Force, and
the studies during the past 6 years have been supported by NASA.
Recently, these studies have received less support or have been terminated
in favor of critical studies on the effects of biologically important
environmental extreme factors on Earth organisms. These critical studies
permit establishing the extreme environmental factor parameters in
which Earth life can grow or survive. These data will have valuable
application to the consideration of life on any planet, to the design of
life-detection instruments, to the sterilization of space vehicles, and to
the problem of contamination of planets.</p>
<p class="pnext">Some exploratory experimental studies are in progress to study the
capabilities of organisms to grow under the assumed conditions on
Jupiter. These include studies at high pressure with liquid ammonia,
methane, and other reducing compounds.</p>
<p class="pnext">Early experiments simulating Martian conditions using soil bacteria
were carried out by Davis and Fulton (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-70" id="id75">[ref.70]</a>) at the Air Force School of
Aviation Medicine, San Antonio, Tex. Mixed populations of soil
bacteria were put in "Mars jars" with the following conditions: 65-mm
Hg pressure, 1 percent water or less, nitrogen atmosphere, sandstone-lava
soil, and a temperature day-night cycle of +25° to -25° C. The
moisture was controlled by desiccating the soil and adding a given
amount of water. Experiments, conducted up to 10 months, demonstrated
that obligate aerobes died quickly. The anaerobes and sporeformers
survived. Although a small increase in the total number of
organisms indicated growth, the increases in the number of bacteria may
have been due to breaking up clumps of dirt.</p>
<p class="pnext">Roberts and Irvine (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-71" id="id76">[ref.71]</a>) reported that, in a simulated Martian
environment, colony counts of a sporeforming bacterium, <em class="italics">Bacillus cereus</em>,
increased when 8 percent moisture was added. Moisture was considered
more important than temperature or atmospheric gases inasmuch as a
simulated Martian microenvironment containing 8 percent moisture
permitted germination and growth of endospores of <em class="italics">Clostridium sporogenes</em>.

<p class="pfirst">Studies of the effects of simulated Martian environments on sporeforming
anaerobic bacteria were carried out by Hawrylewicz et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-49" id="id78">[ref.49]</a>).
They showed that the encapsulated facultative anaerobe, <em class="italics">Klebsiella
pneumoniae</em>, survived under simulated Martian atmosphere for 6 to 8
months, but were less virulent than the freshly isolated organisms.
Spores of the anaerobe <em class="italics">Clostridium botulinum</em> survived 10 months in the
simulator. Hagen et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-53" id="id79">[ref.53]</a>) found that the addition of moisture to
dry-simulated Martian soil did not improve the survival of <em class="italics">Bacillus
subtilis</em> or <em class="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. <em class="italics">Bacillus cereus</em> spores survived,
with added organic medium plus moisture, but no germination of the
spores resulted.</p>
<p class="pnext">Hawrylewicz et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-49" id="id80">[ref.49]</a>) put rocks from Antarctica bearing various
lichens in simulated Martian conditions in a large desiccator. They
found that the algal portion of a lichen, <em class="italics">Trebouxia erici</em>, showed only
slight resistance to the Martian environment. They also pointed out the
effect moisture had on the physical condition of lichens. The undersurface
of a lichen has great water-absorbing capability, and the slightest
amount of moisture on a rock surface is absorbed by the lichen which can
turn green in 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="pnext">Scher et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-51" id="id81">[ref.51]</a>) exposed desert soils to simulated environmental
conditions and diurnal cycles of Mars. The atmosphere consisted of 95
percent nitrogen and 5 percent carbon dioxide (no oxygen) and was
dried, using calcium sulfate as a desiccant. The total atmospheric
pressure was 0.1 atm. The temperature ranged from -60° to +20° C in
24-hour cycles. One hour was spent at the maximum and at the minimum
temperatures. The chambers were irradiated with ultraviolet,
2537 Å, with a dose of 10<sup>9</sup> ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is comparable to a daily dose
found on Mars, and easily exceeds the mean lethal dose for unprotected
bacteria. Soil aliquots were removed weekly and incubated at 30° C.
The scoring was done both aerobically and anaerobically. Sporeforming
obligate and facultative anaerobes, including <em class="italics">Clostridium</em>, <em class="italics">Bacillus</em>, and
<em class="italics">Planosarcina</em>, and nonsporeforming facultative anaerobes, including
<em class="italics">Pseudomonas</em> and <em class="italics">Rhodopseudomonas</em>, were found. The experimental
chambers were frozen and thawed cyclically up to 6 months. Organisms
that were able to survive the first freeze-thaw cycle were able to survive
the entire experiment. The ultraviolet irradiation did not kill subsurface
organisms, and a thin layer of soil served as an ultraviolet shield.
All of the samples showed survivors.</p>
<p class="pnext">Young et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-52" id="id82">[ref.52]</a>) assumed that water is present on Mars, at least in
microenvironments, and that nutrients would be available. The primary
<span class="pageno target" title="34" id="page-34"> </span>objective of their experiments was to determine the likelihood of
contaminating Mars with Earth organisms should a space probe from Earth
encounter an optimum microenvironment in terms of water and nutrients.
The experiments used bacteria in liquid nutrient media. The
environment consisted of a carbon dioxide-nitrogen atmosphere, and
the temperature cycling was -70° to +25° C, with a maximum time
above freezing of 4½ hours. <em class="italics">Aerobacter aerogenes</em> and <em class="italics">Pseudomonas sp.</em>
grew in nutrient medium under Martian freezing and thawing cycles.
Atmospheric pressure was not a significant factor in the growth of
bacteria under these conditions.</p>
<p class="pnext">Silverman et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-47" id="id83">[ref.47]</a>) studied bacteria and a fungus under extreme—but
not "Martian"—conditions. Spores of five test organisms (<em class="italics">B. subtilis</em>
var. <em class="italics">niger</em>, <em class="italics">B. megaterium</em>, <em class="italics">B. stearothermophilus</em>, <em class="italics">Clostridium sporogenes,</em>
and <em class="italics">Aspergillus niger</em>) and soils were exposed while under ultrahigh
vacuum to temperatures of from -190° to +170° C for 4 to 5 days.
Up to 25° C there was no loss in viability; at higher temperatures, differences
in resistivity were observed. At 88° C, only <em class="italics">B. subtilis</em> and <em class="italics">A. niger</em>
survived in appreciable numbers; at 107° C, only <em class="italics">A. niger</em> spores survived;
none were recoverable after exposure to 120° C. <em class="italics">B. subtilis</em> survived
at atmospheric pressure and 90° C for 5 days, but none of the other
spores were viable alter 2 days. Four groups of soil organisms (mesophilic,
aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria, molds, and actinomycetes) were similarly
tested in the vacuum chamber. From one sample only actinomycetes
survived 120° C, while one other soil sample yielded viable bacteria after
exposure to 170° C. Several organisms resisted 120° C in ultrahigh
vacuum for 4 to 5 days. When irradiated with gamma rays from a cobalt
60 source, differences were observed between vacuum-dried spores
irradiated while under vacuum and those exposed to air immediately
before irradiation. A reduction of from one-third to one-ninth of the
viability of spores irradiated in vacuum occurred with vacuum-treated
spores irradiated in air.</p>
<p class="pnext">Siegel et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-73" id="id84">[ref.73]</a>), in approximate simulations of Martian environments,
studied tolerances of certain seed plants, such as cucumbers, corn,
and winter rye, to low temperatures and lowered oxygen tensions.
Lowered oxygen tensions enhanced the resistance of seedlings, particularly
cucumber and rye to freezing, and lowered the minimum temperature
required for germination. Germination of seeds in the absence of
liquid water has also been studied. In this case, seeds of xerophytes have
been suspended in air at 75-mm Hg pressure above water. The air was
thus saturated. Germination was slow but did occur.</p>
<p class="pnext">Siegel et al. (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-73" id="id85">[ref.73]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-74" id="id86">[ref.74]</a>) found that the growth rate of several
higher plants was enhanced by certain gases usually thought to be toxic,
<span class="pageno target" title="35" id="page-35"> </span>such as N<sub>2</sub>O. This finding is significant inasmuch as the presence of
nitrogen oxides in the Martian atmosphere has been cited as evidence
for the nonexistence of plants on that planet by Kiess et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-75" id="id87">[ref.75]</a>).
Exploratory survival tests showed that various mature plants, as well as
the larvae, pupae, and adult specimens of a coleopteran insect, were
undamaged when exposed to at least 40 hours of an atmosphere containing
96.5 percent N<sub>2</sub>O, 0.7 percent O<sub>2</sub>, and 2.8 percent N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="pnext">Lichens are of interest because of their ability to survive and thrive
under extreme environmental conditions on Earth. Biological activity
of slow-growing lichens was detected by metabolic gas exchange, CO<sub>2</sub>
detection being especially convenient. Siegel points out that this method
is sensitive and nondestructive, to be preferred to staining techniques,
which at present are limited because they are only semiquantitative, subjective,
and destructive of the lichen.</p>
<p class="pnext">A Russian study of simulated planetary environments has been performed
with good simulation but for periods of only 2 to 6 hours. Comments
on simulation experiments made by Zhukova and Kondratyev (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-69" id="id88">[ref.69]</a>)
are presented as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="pfirst">On the basis of modern conceptions on Martian conditions it is difficult to imagine
that higher forms of animals or plants exist on the planet. A Martian change of seasons
similar to that of our planet empowers us to think that there is a circulation of
an organic substance on Mars, which cannot exist without participation of microbic
forms of life. Microorganisms are the most probable inhabitants of Mars although the
possibility is not excluded that their physiological features will be very specific. That
is why the solution of the problem concerning the character of life on Mars is of exceptional
interest. But still the answer to this question can be verified only by simulating
Martian conditions, taking into account the information obtained from astrophysicists.</p>
<p class="pnext">Experiments aimed at creating artificial Martian climatic conditions have been
started quite recently; their number is not large since they cannot be combined with
the results of numerous experiments investigating the effect of extreme factors on
microorganisms. The result of the effect of such physicochemical parameters of the
medium as pressure, sharp temperature changes, the absence of oxygen and insolation,
depends on their combination and simultaneity. These examples convincingly show
that while simulating Martian conditions one should strive to the most comprehensive
complex of simultaneously acting factors. The creation of individual climatic parameters
acting successively leads to absolutely different, often opposite results. It should
be mentioned also that refusal to imitate insolation and the performance of experiments
with specimens of soil which itself has protective effect on cells of microorganisms,
but not with pure culture of bacteria, are usual shortcomings in the bulk of
studies on this problem.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">It appears that organisms from Earth might survive in large numbers
when introduced to Martian environment. Whether these organisms
will be capable of growth and explosive contamination of the planet in a
biological sense or not is highly questionable. The likelihood of an
organism from Earth finding ideal conditions for growth on Mars seems
<span class="pageno target" title="36" id="page-36"> </span>extremely low. However, the likelihood of an organism from Earth
serving as a contaminant for any life-detection device flown to Mars for
the purpose of searching out carbon-based life is considerably higher.
The chance that life has originated and evolved on Mars is a completely
separate question and much more difficult to answer.</p>
<p class="pnext">It would be interesting to attempt to determine possible evolutionary
trends which might occur on a planet by means of selection of organisms
in a simulated planetary environment. Rapid genetic selection combined
with radiation and chemicals to speed up mutation rate under these
conditions should reveal possible evolutionary trends under the planetary
environmental conditions. This could be attempted after the planetary
environments are more accurately defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="extreme-and-limiting-environmental-parameters-of-life">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">EXTREME AND LIMITING ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS OF LIFE</h3>
<p class="pfirst">The question of the existence of extraterrestrial life is one of the most
important and interesting biological questions facing mankind and has
been the subject of much controversial discussion and conjecture. Many
of the quantitative, and even qualitative, environmental constituents of
the planets also are still subjects of controversy and speculation. Best
guesses about a relatively unknown planetary environment, combined
with lack of information about the capabilities of Earth life to grow
in extreme environments, do not provide the basis for making informed
scientific estimates.</p>
<p class="pnext">Life on Earth is usually considered to be relatively limited in its ability
to grow, reproduce, or survive in extreme environmental conditions.
While many common plants and animals (including man) are quite
sensitive to, or incapable of, surviving severe chemical and physical
changes or extremes of environment, a large number of micro-organisms
are highly adapted and flourish in environments usually considered
lethal. Certain chemoautotrophic bacteria require high concentrations
of ammonia, methane, or other chemicals to grow. Anaerobic bacteria
grow only in the absence of oxygen.</p>
<p class="pnext">Besides adapting to the extremes of environments on Earth, life is also
capable of growing and reproducing under extreme environmental conditions
not normally encountered: e.g., from a few rad of radiation in
normal habitats to 10<sup>6</sup> or more rad from artificial sources, from 0.5 gauss
of Earth magnetism to 167 000 gauss in manmade magnetic fields, and
from 1-g force of gravity to 110 000 g. The extreme ranges of physical
and chemical environmental factors for growth, reproduction, and survival
for Earth micro-organisms are phenomenally large.</p>
<p class="pnext">Life is ubiquitous on Earth and is found in almost every possible
environment, including the most severe habitats, from the bottom of the
<span class="pageno target" title="37" id="page-37"> </span>ocean to the highest mountain tops and from cold Arctic habitats to hot
springs, as well as in volcanic craters, deep wells, salt flats, and mountain
snowfields. Earth life has become adapted to, and has invaded, nearly
every habitat, no matter how severe. The physiological and morphological
adaptations of life are exceedingly diverse and complex.</p>
<p class="pnext">Surprisingly, the extreme parameters or ranges of the physical and
chemical environmental factors permitting growth, reproduction, and
other physiological processes of Earth organisms have not been critically
compiled. A partial compilation of certain selected environmental
factors has been made by Vallentyne (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-76" id="id89">[ref.76]</a>). A compilation of available
published data on certain environmental extremes, particularly from
recent NASA-supported research (compiled by Dale W. Jenkins, in press),
is presented in tables <a class="reference internal pginternal" href="#table-iii">III</a> to <a class="reference internal pginternal" href="#table-vi">VI</a>. These data can serve as a starting point
for a more intensive literature review by specialists, critical evaluation,
standardization of end points, and especially to point out areas where
critical experimentation is urgently needed.</p>
<p class="pnext">This critical compilation involves a review of a very broad and complex
range of subjects involved in many different disciplines with widely
scattered literature. Since the effects of many of the specific environmental
factors are harmful, it is difficult to select a point on a scale from
no effect to death and use some criteria to say that normal or even minimal
growth and reproduction are occurring. The effects of environmental
factors are dependent on (1) the specific factor, times, (2) the
concentration or energy, times, (3) the time of exposure or application of
the factor. Many reports, especially older ones, do not give all of the
necessary data to permit proper evaluation. A complicating factor is that
the effect of each factor depends on the other factors before, during, and
after its application. The condition of the organism itself is a great
variable. Proper evaluation requires the critical review by a variety of
biological specialists, physicists, and chemists.</p>
<p class="pnext">To determine the potential of Earth organisms to survive or grow
under other planetary environmental conditions, a number of experiments
have been carried out attempting to simulate planetary environments,
especially of Mars, as reviewed previously. While the results are
of real interest, they do not provide much basic information. Further, as
the Martian environment is more accurately defined, the experimental
conditions are changed. In addition, some experimenters have altered
certain factors, such as water content, to allow for potential microhabitats
or for areas which might contain more water at certain times.</p>

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">EFFECTS OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT ON BEHAVIOR</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">N</span><span class="dropspan small-caps">ASA was established in 1958</span>, shortly after the Russian launching of
the second Earth satellite Sputnik II, the first vehicle to carry life
into orbit around the Earth. This accomplishment was preceded by the
pioneering work of Henry et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-77" id="id90">[ref.77]</a>), in which animals were exposed
briefly to low-gravity states in Aerobee rockets. A motion-picture camera
photographed the behavior of two white mice in rotating drums during
this series of flights, which marked the first time that simple psychological
tests were made on animals in the weightless condition. While this
behavioral experiment was relatively simple, it provided the basic concepts
for recent studies which involved rotation of animals during the
weightless state. Subsequent flights such as Project MIA (Mouse-in-Able)
reflected a preoccupation with physiologic measures (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-78" id="id91">[ref.78]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-79" id="id92">[ref.79]</a>),
although the flights of Baker and Able included preflight and postflight
performance studies (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-80" id="id93">[ref.80]</a>). Able's behavior was recorded in detail on
in-flight film, but none of the behavior was programed or under experimental
control.</p>
<p class="pnext">The first flights in which behavior or performance was explicitly programed
were those of Sam and Miss Sam in flights of the Little Joe rocket
with the Mercury capsule, launched from Wallops Island in 1959 and
1960 (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-81" id="id94">[ref.81]</a>). The first major space achievement in the behavioral
sciences was the successful in-flight measurement of the behavior of the
chimpanzee Ham in early 1961, in which the pretrained animal performed
throughout the flight. The second achievement along these lines
was in 1962 when the chimpanzee Enos made several orbits around Earth
and performed continuously on a complex behavioral task. The tasks
which the animals performed during these flights have been described
in detail by Belleville et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-82" id="id95">[ref.82]</a>), and the results of the in-flight
<span class="pageno target" title="44" id="page-44"> </span>performance have been presented by Henry and Mosely (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-83" id="id96">[ref.83]</a>). These
early flights provided much of the technological framework on which
current biological experiments on organisms during flights of extended
duration are based. Due largely to the efforts of Grunzke (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-84" id="id97">[ref.84]</a> and
<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-85" id="id98">[ref.85]</a>), the apparatus needed to sustain animals during space flight, such as
zero-g watering and feeding devices, are now commonplace (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-86" id="id99">[ref.86]</a>).
Advanced systems of programing stimulus presentations and recording
responses, developed for Project Mercury, may now be seen in many
basic research laboratories throughout the country.</p>
<p class="pnext">Several other noteworthy advances have been made as an outgrowth
of the Mercury animal flights. Immediately before the orbital flight
MA-5, in which the chimpanzee Enos was employed, it was unexpectedly
found that this 5-year-old animal was hypertensive. Subsequent centrifuge
studies showed that its vascular responses exceeded those of a control
group. Consideration of the animal's preflight experience led to speculation
concerning the origin of this hypertension. An explanation of the
high-blood-pressure responses detected in Enos has been pursued by
Meehan et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-87" id="id100">[ref.87]</a>). Persistent hypertension has been produced in
other laboratory chimpanzees restrained in the same manner as those
participating in space flight and exposed to demanding performance
tasks, a demonstration which has important implications for prolonged
manned space flight and for cardiovascular medicine in general.</p>
<p class="pnext">Studies more directly concerned with behavior and performance have
been extended from those of Project Mercury. These extensions have
been in the following directions: (1) the establishment and maintenance
of complex behavioral repertoires under conditions of full environmental
control, (2) the refinement of behavioral techniques for assessing sensory
and motor processes, and (3) the maintenance of sustained performance
under conditions of long-term isolation and confinement and preliminary
extension of such experimental analysis to man.</p>
<p class="pnext">Numerous studies with primate subjects, including several at Ames
Research Center, have been devoted to developing methods for maintaining
optimum performance in environments with limited sources of
stimulation. Monkeys, baboons, and chimpanzees, for example, have
been isolated for periods of longer than 2 years with no decrement in
performance on complicated behavioral tasks (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-88" id="id101">[ref.88]</a>). The behavioral
techniques used in these studies are closely related to those employed on
human subjects under NASA sponsorship at the University of Maryland
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-89" id="id102">[ref.89]</a>). The essence of these techniques is in the proper programing
of environmental stimuli (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-90" id="id103">[ref.90]</a>). It is not sufficient to provide the subject
with his physiological requirements for survival, but he must be
given the psychological motivation for using these provisions. This
<span class="pageno target" title="45" id="page-45"> </span>statement, of course, is an oversimplification of the problem, but it serves
to illustrate the essence of these experimental programs.</p>
<p class="pnext">Gravity has long been known as one of the major factors influencing
various life processes and the orientation of both plants and animals.
One of the most challenging problems of space research has been to define
this influence more precisely. Related to the effect of gravity on living
processes is the problem of the effects of weightlessness. Of particular
interest to psychologists are the possible modifications an altered gravitational
environment might produce in behavioral patterns basic to the
animal's maintenance and survival, such as eating, sensory and discriminative
processes, development and maturation, and learning capacity
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-91" id="id104">[ref.91]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">One prominent method of studying gravitational effects is to simulate
an increase in gravity by centrifugation. Smith et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-92" id="id105">[ref.92]</a>) and Winget
et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-93" id="id106">[ref.93]</a>) have investigated the effects of long-term acceleration on
birds, primarily chickens, while Wunder (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-94" id="id107">[ref.94]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-95" id="id108">[ref.95]</a>) and his
coworkers (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-96" id="id109">[ref.96]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-99" id="id110">[ref.99]</a>) have used fruit flies, mice, rats, hamsters, and
turtles. The general findings are that, when animals are subjected to a
prolonged period of acceleration of moderate intensity, they exhibit
decreased growth, delayed maturation, and an increase in the size of
certain muscles and organs, dependent on the species. With regard to
the decreased growth effect, the data of these investigators show some
exceptions. When the gravitational increase is kept below a certain
limit, growth was greater than that of controls in the fruit fly, turtle,
mouse, and chicken. The limit below which enhancement of growth
was observed varied with the species studied.</p>
<p class="pnext">The data on food intake do not present a consistent picture. Wunder
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-94" id="id111">[ref.94]</a>) found that food intake in accelerated mice was markedly reduced
from that of nonaccelerated control animals. Smith, however, found
that in chickens, food intake increased up to 36 percent over controls
and has derived an exponential relation between food intake and
acceleration. After six generations of selective breeding, Smith has produced
a strain of chickens better adapted to prolonged exposure to high g.</p>
<p class="pnext">A very relevant finding of their research with birds was that exposure
to chronic acceleration in some way appears to interfere with habituation
to rotatory stimulation. Chickens who were being subjected to chronic
acceleration were given repeated rotatory stimulation tests to estimate
their labyrinthine sensitivity. This study revealed that centrifuged animals
showed a marked reduction in labyrinthine sensitivity. This result
appeared to persist after the acceleration was terminated. In animals
who developed gait or postural difficulties as a result of acceleration,
there was no evidence of a postnystagmus in response to the rotatory
<span class="pageno target" title="46" id="page-46"> </span>stimulation test, which the investigators point out may be evidence of a
lesion in the labyrinth or its neural pathways.</p>
<p class="pnext">Smith has implicated social factors as interfering with acceleration
effects. His subjects were typically accelerated four or six to a cage.
When groups were mixed midway through the experiment, they exhibited
a higher mortality rate and incidence of acceleration symptoms than did
groups whose constituency remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the U.S. Naval School of Aerospace Medicine, numerous studies
have been conducted on the effects of slow rotation on the behavior and
physiology of humans and animals (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-100" id="id112">[ref.100]</a>). Rotation initially produces
decrements in performance, but adaptation to a rotating environment
ensues quite rapidly (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-101" id="id113">[ref.101]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-103" id="id114">[ref.103]</a>). Perceptual distortion, nystagmus,
nausea, and other signs of discomfort are common responses to slow
rotation. These symptoms are generally reduced with continued
exposure (adaptation). Interestingly, however, adaptation is delayed
when the subjects are exposed to a fixed reference outside their rotating
environment.</p>
<p class="pnext">At NASA-Ames, rodents have been used in experiments by Weissman
and Seldeen to delimit the stimulus effects of rotation. In these experiments
the subjects must discriminate between different speeds of rotation
in order to obtain food reinforcement. The results thus far provide
evidence that these animals are capable of discriminating between the
different speeds at which they are being rotated. The range of speeds
studied was 0-25 rpm, with tests of discrimination being made at intervals
of less than 5 rpm. Experiments such as these will lead to the
development of techniques for measuring rotational sensitivity in many
species, including man.</p>
<p class="pnext">The optimum configuration of manned spacecraft will depend, in
part, upon biomedical considerations. A voluminous literature now
exists on the possible hazards to man of prolonged exposure to zero-g
conditions. Should prolonged weightlessness prove to be a serious detriment
to health, consideration must be given to design concepts which
provide artificial gravity.</p>
<p class="pnext">No data exist on the minimum gravity requirements necessary to
sustain basic biological functions for extended periods. A limit of 0.2 g
has been given as the lower level at which man can walk unaided
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-104" id="id114a">[ref.104]</a>).
It has also been recommended that angular velocity be maintained
at the lowest possible level in order to minimize the occurrence of
vestibular disturbances. These recommendations are based on human-factor
requirements, rather than upon biological considerations, which
may significantly modify these values. In recent studies, a technique
has been devised which promises to provide reliable criteria for biological
<span class="pageno target" title="47" id="page-47"> </span>acceptability, since it is based on fundamental biological and behavioral
principles.</p>
<p class="pnext">As animals progress up the evolutionary stale, their survival depends
less and less upon stereotyped physiological reactions which occur in
reflex fashion, in response to environmental stimulation. In higher
organisms, survival depends more upon the capacity of organisms to
modify their behavior. At the highest levels of functional efficiency, the
ultimate form of adaptation is seen—the manipulation of the environment
by the organism. Developments in behavioral science now permit
us to utilize the adaptive behavior of animals to investigate many problems
of biological interest. Recent studies on the self-selection of gravity
levels represent a further attempt to exploit the adaptive capacities of
animals, in order to provide information relevant to problems of space
exploration.</p>
<p class="pnext">One such project allows animals to select their own gravity environment
in an apparatus designed to create g-forces through centrifugal
action by rotation at 60 rpm (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-105" id="id115">[ref.105]</a>). The surface of this centrifuge is
parabolic, so that the resultant of the centrifugal g and the Earth's gravity
is always normal to the surface. When the animal moves away from
the center, increasing the radius of rotation, it is exposed to increasing
gravity. Motion toward the center reduces the gravity level. By this
means, an animal is free to select its own gravity environment.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the animal moves toward or away from the center, he is moving
from one tangential velocity to another. He is therefore acted upon by
a third force—due to Coriolis acceleration. The effects of Coriolis forces
are a major problem difficult to eliminate in studies such as these, but
they must be taken into account in the design of spacecraft which produce
artificial gravity by rotation. Motion of the head in any direction not
parallel to the centrifugal force vector would result in bizarre stimulation
of the semicircular canals and consequent motion sickness. This effect
is likely to become even more pronounced if the sensitivity of these
organs is increased by prolonged exposure to reduced gravity. Methods
such as these are currently being developed for conducting a refined
psychophysical analysis of gravity, including studies by Lange and
Broderson on the perception of angular, linear, and Coriolis acceleration.</p>
<p class="pnext">The results of animal studies such as these will be of great value in
arriving at a decisive judgment concerning the need for artificial gravity
in a manned orbiting space station, or other vehicles designed for long-term
occupancy.</p>
<p class="pnext">To aid in the interpretation of in-flight data, other studies are underway
to determine the functions of the vestibular system, as a principal
brain center related to orientation in space and to the physiology of
<span class="pageno target" title="48" id="page-48"> </span>posture and movement, as well as with the influences of acceleration,
rotation, and weightlessness. Experiments are presently being conducted
on monkeys and cats in order to trace these complex neurological connections
and to determine their functional organization.</p>

<div class="level-3 section" id="biological-information-systems">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h3>
<p class="pfirst">The nature of memory has been the subject of considerable speculation
in the past. It has long been felt intuitively that retention of information
in the central nervous system involves either an alteration of preexisting
material or structure, or, alternatively, synthesis of materials not present
previously. The cellular site of operational alteration was unknown but,
again intuitively, was felt to be closely associated with the synapses. The
problems faced by early investigators were great; but nevertheless much
information relevant to the question of biological information storage
was obtained. With the relatively recent advent of more refined tools
and methodologies, there has been rapid progress.</p>
<p class="pnext">A significant amount of the work which has been conducted in the
area of biological information and communication systems is easily
classified as "basic research" (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-106" id="id116">[ref.106]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-109" id="id117">[ref.109]</a>). This discussion will be
limited to those aspects closely related to the fields of molecular biology
and experimental psychology, which seem to have universal application
to all known animal life forms. Studies involving the basic principles
of acquisition, processing, storage, and retrieval of information in living
systems are emphasized.</p>
<div class="level-4 section" id="early-work">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Early Work</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Early speculations on the operational nature of memory have been
based upon relatively little experimental evidence. Charles Darwin
observed that domestic rabbits had smaller brains than their wild
counterparts, and attributed this to lack of exercise of their intellect,
senses, and voluntary movements. Unfortunately, subsequent studies of
the brains of men with greatly differing intellectual capability did not
substantiate the hypothesis. Idiots sometimes had larger brains than
geniuses. Later, an idea proposed by Ramon y Cajal came into favor.
Since brain cells did not increase in number after birth, he proposed
that memory involved the establishment of new and more extended
intercortical connections. Unfortunately, methods were not available
to test this hypothesis adequately and it has remained until quite
recently in the realm of conjecture.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another major hypothesis was that there were two or more stages in
the information storage process. The final form the information took
in the brain was called a brain engram, or memory trace. However,
<span class="pageno target" title="49" id="page-49"> </span>prior to the formation of the engram, a transitory process denoted as
"reverberational memory" was postulated to exist for a relatively short
time (minutes to hours) (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-106" id="id118">[ref.106]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-107" id="id119">[ref.107]</a>). This hypothesis was used
by Pauling to explain why an elderly chairman of a board could brilliantly
summarize a complex 8-hour meeting and yet, after its conclusion
and his return to his office, not even remember having attended the
meeting. Thus, this individual's reverberational memory functioned
well, but advanced years had seriously impaired his brain's ability to
form a permanent engram. Similar, although less dramatic, observations
in other situations are not uncommon. A wide variety of experiments
have been conducted to study this aspect of memory and to relate it to
the process whereby the information is transformed to a more stable
form (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-110" id="id120">[ref.110]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-112" id="id121">[ref.112]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">More recently, the concept of a specific biochemical activity during the
process of long-term storage of information has gained considerable favor.
Initially, neither the site nor the nature of the change was well defined.
Quite recent studies by Krech et al. (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-113" id="id122">[ref.113]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-114" id="id123">[ref.114]</a>), Bennett et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-115" id="id124">[ref.115]</a>), Rosenzweig et al. (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-116" id="id125">[ref.116]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-117" id="id126">[ref.117]</a>) support the view that alteration
of the levels of acetylcholinesterase at cortical synapses play an important
role in information storage. These studies will be discussed in a later
section. However, these authors do not claim that the changes observed
are unambiguously related to the storage of memory. It may well be that
the alterations observed are in some way related to this process but are
still secondary to some other, more basic, process.</p>
<p class="pnext">An alternative hypothesis is that the information resides in its ultimate
form in some more central structure of the neurone than the synapse.
(It has even been postulated that the basic information is stored in
nonneuronocortical material.) Perhaps Halstead was the first to postulate
the involvement of nucleoprotein in this process (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-107" id="id127">[ref.107]</a>). From the
biochemist's point of view, this is an extremely attractive hypothesis.
Both proteins and nucleic acids possess sufficient possible permutations
of structure to permit storage of a lifetime's accumulation of information
in an organ the size of the brain. From the previously known ability of
the nucleic acids to code genetic information, they are the prime suspects.
However, from the known regulatory ability of nucleic acids in specific
protein synthesis, it is possible that the final repository is protein.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="recent-biochemical-studies">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Recent Biochemical Studies</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Among the foremost investigators of the chemistry and biochemistry
of the central nervous system is Holger Hyden at the University of
Göteborg, Sweden. He and others (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-118" id="id128">[ref.118]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-120" id="id129">[ref.120]</a>) have for many years
performed elegant microanalytical studies of single nerve cells. The
<span class="pageno target" title="50" id="page-50"> </span>evidence which Hyden has obtained is consistent with the hypothesis that
the initial electrical reverberations in the brain induce a change in the
molecular structure of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the neurones which,
in turn, leads to a subsequent deposition of specific proteins. It is well
known from other investigations that a major role of RNA in any type
of cell is to specify and mediate synthesis of the protein enzymes of the
cells. Thus, in this hypothesis, it is only necessary to postulate the
modification of brain RNA by the activities associated with reverberational
memory. Particularly pertinent to this hypothesis are observations
that—</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">Large nerve cells have a very high rate of metabolism of RNA and
proteins, and, of the somatic cells, are the largest producers of
RNA.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Vestibular stimulation by passive means leads to an increase in the
RNA content of the Deiters nerve cells of rabbits (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-121" id="id130">[ref.121]</a>). The
protein content of these cells is also increased.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Changes in the RNA composition of neurones and glia of the
brainstem occur during a learning situation. Animals were
trained over a period of 4 to 5 days to climb a steeply inclined
wire to obtain food. The big nerve cells and the glia of their
lateral vestibular apparatus were analyzed, since the Deiters
neurones present in this structure are directly connected to the
middle ear. The amount of RNA was found to be increased in
the nerve cells; and, more significantly, the adenine-to-uracil
ratio of both the nuclear RNA of nerve cells and glia cells
became significantly increased (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-119" id="id131">[ref.119]</a>). A variety of control
experiments were conducted. Although there was an increase
in RNA content of these cells in animals exposed to passive
stimulation, there was no change in the ratio of adenine to
uracil. Nerve cells from the reticular formation, another portion
of the brain, had only an increased content of RNA with no
base-ratio change. Animals subjected to a stress experiment
involving the vestibular nucleus showed only an increase in
content of RNA. Littermates living in cages on the same diet
as learning animals showed no change in content of RNA.
Thus, it would appear that the change in the base ratio of the
RNA synthesized is not due to increased neurone function per
se, but is more directly related to the learning process. The fact
that this was nuclear RNA implies that it was immediately
related to chromosomal DNA.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Neuronal RNA with changed cytosine-guanine ratios synthesized
during a short period of induced protein synthesis could be
<span class="pageno target" title="51" id="page-51"> </span>blocked by actinomycin D. It was concluded, therefore, that the
RNA was immediately DNA dependent and directly related to
the genetic apparatus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">Rats which were normally right handed were forced to modify their
handedness in order to obtain food. The RNA of nerve cells in that
part of the cortex, whose destruction destroys the ability to transfer
handedness, was analyzed. A significant increase in RNA of nerve cells
of the fifth to sixth cortical layers on the right side of the brain was
observed. The corresponding nerve cells on the opposite side of the
same brain served as controls. There was an increase in RNA and a
significant increase in the purine bases relative to the pyrimidine bases
in the learning side of the cortex. When the animals were not forced to
learn a new procedure, only an increase of RNA was observed, with no
change in base ratio.</p>
<p class="pnext">Frank Morrell, head of the Neurology Department at Stanford Medical
School, has also been active in this field during the past 6 years. He
has found that if a primary epileptic lesion is induced on one side of the
cortex, a secondary mirror lesion eventually develops in the contralateral
homologous cortex. This secondary lesion, which showed self-sustaining
epileptiform discharge, could be isolated, whereupon the epileptiform
discharge disappeared. This was interpreted as learned behavior of the
secondary lesion. From changes in the staining properties of the
secondary lesion, Morrell concluded that changes in RNA had occurred
in the cell. Changes in the composition of the RNA could not be shown
by these techniques.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the University of California at Berkeley, Drs. Rosenzweig, Bennett,
and Krech have conducted extensive studies related to this topic. These
investigators have directed their efforts toward demonstrating alterations
in the cerebral cortex of animals exposed to continuing learning situations
or continuously deprived of sensory stimulation. In a recent publication
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-116" id="id132">[ref.116]</a>), which also summarizes a considerable amount of
previous work, they report studies which demonstrate the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">Rats given enriched experience develop, in comparison with their
restricted littermates, greater weight and thickness of cortical
tissue and an associated proportional increase in total
acetylcholinesterase activity of the cortex.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The gain in weight of cortical tissue is relatively larger than the
increase in enzymatic activity. Acetylcholinesterase activity
increases in other portions of the brain even though tissue weight
decreases.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The changes appear in a variety of lines of rats, although differing
in amount between strains.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst"><span class="pageno target" title="52" id="page-52"> </span>The changes are observed in both the young and adult animals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The previous studies were comparisons between experience-enriched
animals and animals maintained in isolation. Animals which were
housed in colonies, but given no special treatment, showed intermediate
effects in those situations studied.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Berkeley group emphasized that the finding of changes in the
brain subsequent to experience does not prove that the changes have
anything to do with memory storage, but do establish the fact that the
brain can respond to environmental pressure. However, the results are
compatible with the hypothesis that long-term memory storage involves
the formation of new somatic connections among neurones. Calculations
of the amount of additional material required to permit this to exist
are compatible with the increases observed.</p>
<p class="pnext">A number of investigators have studied the effects of antimetabolites
and drugs on the learning process. Since their specific metabolic effects
are known in other tissues, the rationale is that if these materials do
interfere with memory, then specific types of metabolic activities may be
implicated in the deposition of the engram.</p>
<p class="pnext">One of the initial studies of this type was conducted by Dingman and
Sporn (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-122" id="id133">[ref.122]</a>), presently at the National Institute of Mental Health.
They showed that 8-azaguanine, a purine antagonist, injected intra-cisternally
was incorporated into the RNA of the brains of rats. Associated
with this incorporation was an impairment of the maze-learning
ability of the animals. These findings have been confirmed.</p>
<p class="pnext">Flexner and his associates injected puromycin, an inhibitor of protein
synthesis, into the brains of mice, which were then trained to perform in
a maze. Losses of short-term or long-term memory were obtained,
depending upon the site of the injection. The results indicate that the
hippocampal region is the site of recent memory.</p>
<p class="pnext">The hippocampal region is of interest in connection with memory
processes for a number of other reasons. Adey et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-123" id="id134">[ref.123]</a>) and his
group observed a transient fall in electrical impedance in this region
when cats learned to perform in a T-maze in response to a visual cue. It
was supposed that the electrodes were situated within glial cells of the
dendritic zone of the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer. Extinction of
the learned habit abolished the briefly evoked impedance changes,
which subsequently reappeared with retraining.</p>
<p class="pnext">A number of other studies more or less indirectly implicate RNA in
the learning processes. For instance, in retinal cells of rabbits raised in
darkness, there was virtually no ribonucleoprotein as compared with
normal amounts in the cells of animals raised in light (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-124" id="id135">[ref.124]</a>). Further,
maintenance of normal electrical activity of isolated perfused cat brains
<span class="pageno target" title="53" id="page-53"> </span>is highly dependent upon the presence of the ribonucleic acid precursors,
uridine and cytidine, in the perfusate (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-125" id="id136">[ref.125]</a>), and severe derangements
occur if any of a variety of pyrimidine antagonists are added (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-126" id="id137">[ref.126]</a>).
Brief electrical stimulation of cat cortical tissue causes an increase in
nucleic acid cytidine and adenine, thus indicating a synthesis of altered
polynucleotides. Finally, injections of RNA in animals have shown
interesting effects. When given at a dose of 116 mg/kg daily for 1 month,
rats showed an enhanced response and greater resistance to extinction in
a shock-motivated behavioral response. It has been shown by another
group that injections of RNA enhance the ability of young animals to
learn various tasks.</p>
<p class="pnext">Planaria have been used in a variety of studies which seem to bear on
the problem of memory. Quite recent evidence by Bennett, Calvin, and
their associates has cast somewhat of a pall over the studies; nevertheless,
the work may have some validity. Interest in the use of flatworms, particularly
planaria, for study of memory began with a demonstration by
McConnell that these simple animals could undergo conditioning (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-127" id="id138">[ref.127]</a>).
Subsequently, it was found that some conditioning was retained
when the animal was transected and allowed to regenerate. The retention
of training was found in both new animals, although the very simple
brain, really only two ganglia, was in the head section (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-128" id="id139">[ref.128]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">Apparently, some diffusely distributed component of the animal was
responsible for retention of learning. Evidence has accumulated to
indicate that this material is RNA. Among this evidence is the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">The two halves of a trained planaria were allowed to regenerate
in a solution containing RNA-destroying enzymes. Whereas
the head ends retained some training, no retention was observed
in the animals derived from the tail end (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-129" id="id140">[ref.129]</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">When pieces of trained planaria were fed to untrained animals,
the untrained cannibal required a shorter time to become
trained to a criterion. It would appear that the digestive system
of planaria is so simple that the material responsible for the
transfer of the information was not broken down.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">When RNA, obtained from trained planaria, is injected into the
digestive tract of untrained animals, there is a transfer of
information.</p>

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">NEUROPHYSIOLOGY<a class="footnote-reference pginternal" href="#id142" id="id141"><sup>2</sup></a></h3>
<p class="pfirst">Neurophysiological studies concern the functions of the nervous system—in
particular the central nervous system (CNS)—under normal, simulated,
and actual flight conditions. Of paramount importance is the
<span class="pageno target" title="54" id="page-54"> </span>maintenance of equilibrium and orientation in three-dimensional space.
The ability of man and his close relatives among the vertebrates to maintain
these functions depends on an integrated sensory input from the
vestibular organ; the eyes; the interoceptors of the muscles, tendons,
joints, and viscera; and the exteroceptors of the skin.</p>
<p class="pnext">Certain parameters of the environmental and space-flight conditions
drastically affect man's ability to maintain equilibrium and spatial
orientation. Centrifugal forces modify or reverse the directional vector
of gravity. Linear acceleration may increase enormously, as may angular
stimulation. The sensory organs listed above are unreliable under such
conditions. The very organ which is designed specifically to furnish
information on spatial orientation may malfunction in man while he is
in flight. Thus, with respect to sensory orientation, these labyrinthine
organs are by no means precision instruments.</p>
<p class="pnext">The use of classical histological methods and the observation of
equilibrium disturbances resulting from operative interference with the
internal ear have in the past been the two principal sources of knowledge
concerning the structure and function of the labyrinth, but the answers
given to various questions vary considerably in their value. The development
of electrophysiological techniques and the refinement in recent
years of the ultrastructural analysis by means of the electron microscope
may allow more precise experimental studies of the correlation of function
and structure.</p>
<p class="pnext">Before considering vestibular impulses in their bulbar and descending
spinal pathways, a recent study concerning the generation of impulses
in the labyrinth must be mentioned. Von Bekesy's finding (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-131" id="id144">[ref.131]</a>) of
the direct current potentials in the cochlea aroused speculation about
the existence of similar labyrinthine potentials. Such dc potentials were
also detected in the semicircular canal of the guinea pig by Trincker (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-132" id="id145">[ref.132]</a>),
who measured the potential changes in the endolymph, surface of
the cupula, or side of the crista during cupular deflection. It seems
likely, however, that the effects do not represent the physicochemical
changes in the cupula but the electrical potentials in the nerve and nerve
endings of the crista. Attempts at differentiating these effects have failed
so far. Great expectations are brought by the advances of microchemistry,
microphysiology, and physical chemistry with regard to the
excitatory processes, the generation of the nerve impulse. Quite apart
from a need to understand vestibular nerve discharges and patterns more
adequately in such terms, the analysis of the vestibular system has in the
past revealed general biological principles which were not readily discernible
through the examination of other tissues (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-133" id="id146">[ref.133]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">The neural connections of the vestibular organ consist of numerous
<span class="pageno target" title="55" id="page-55"> </span>chains of neurons, reciprocally linked in many ways and having their
synapses in various anatomical nuclei. All the chains work in intimate
collaboration, and the final pattern of reflex responses is attributable
largely to the highly complex integrating activity of the center. The
labyrinthine function is automatic, carried out in a reflex fashion: in
other words, mostly below the level of consciousness. The brain centers
through which the labyrinth elicits the various appropriate muscular
reactions of the head, body, limbs, and eyes—the righting, the postural,
and the ocular reflexes—represent an intricate mechanism. Before we
can hope for a satisfactory understanding of their functional organization,
we will have to know their anatomy in more detail. Thus, we are
confronted with a fruitful field for the exploration of basic mechanisms
of neuronal activity. Major advances dining the last years have provided
us with new information about the neuroanatomy of the vestibular
system (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-134" id="id147">[ref.134]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-137" id="id148">[ref.137]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">Vestibular impulses entering the brainstem ascend and descend the
neuroaxis and cross the midline. It was previously believed that the
vestibular apparatus had only subcortical projections. Recently, however,
it has been established by means of electrophysiological methods
that the organ is represented by a projection area in the cerebral cortex
of some animals (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-138" id="id149">[ref.138]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-141" id="id150">[ref.141]</a>). The use of brief electrical stimulation
of the vestibular nerve in order to elicit a cortical response has been of
great value for the mapping of these areas.</p>
<p class="pnext">Among a great variety of sensory receptors, the vestibular ones are
capable of evoking the most widespread somatovisceral effects throughout
the body. Moreover, vestibular effects seem to be imperious and less
dependent upon the state of readiness of the nervous system. As a consequence
of the extensive distribution of vestibular effects, there are many
opportunities for central integration. Proprioceptive and vestibular
systems are both known to be active in posture and locomotion; streams
of impulses arising from the receptors in each of these systems must converge
to influence the activity of the final common path. The state of the
motor centers of the spinal cord, as affected by vestibular stimulation,
has been tested by dorsal root and other sensory input interventions.
These experiments have provided us with insight into the mechanisms
concerned with the vestibular control of spinal reflexes (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-142" id="id151">[ref.142]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-146" id="id152">[ref.146]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">It has long been known that the vestibular apparatus is essential for the
development of motion sickness. Commonplace subjective experience of
nausea relates to visceral changes mediated through autonomic efferent
pathways and may ultimately involve rhythmic somatic nerve discharges
to skeletal muscles responsible for retching and vomiting. However,
very little is known about the central nervous mechanisms responsible
<span class="pageno target" title="56" id="page-56"> </span>for elaboration of the whole syndrome. Since the maintenance of
vestibular bombardment for some length of time seems essential for the
development of motion sickness, one would presume this to be an instance
of slow temporal summation. Experimental findings demonstrate a
powerful effect of temporal summation upon somatic motor outflow
during vestibular stimulation (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-147" id="id153">[ref.147]</a>), and not upon parasympathetic
outflow.</p>
<p class="pnext">The practical implication of these studies is closely related to physiological
effects of weightlessness. Based on experimental evidence from
short weightless periods obtained in aircraft, it was concluded that "when
the exposure becomes longer, there may develop minor physiologic disturbances
which, if cumulative or irritating, may cause or enhance
psychiatric symptoms" (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-148" id="id154">[ref.148]</a>). Although the zero-g condition, per se,
does not cause spatial disorientation if visual cues are provided, the
astronauts reported a temporary loss of orientation during the orbital
flight while they were engaged in activities which diverted their attention.
However, no disturbing sensory inputs were observed during the weightless
period. Violent head maneuvers within the limited mobility of the
helmet were performed in every direction without illusions or vertigo.
The subjective sensations of "tumbling forward" after sustainer engine
cutoff reported by the Mercury astronauts, and Titov's motion sickness
attacks, which were particularly dismaying during head movements, were
well within the entire range of psychosomatic experiences already
obtained during aerodynamic trajectories (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-149" id="id155">[ref.149]</a>). Interestingly enough
it now appears that the otolithic output in mammals including man is the
differential of linear acceleration, and therefore unaffected by zero g.</p>
<p class="pnext">Of interest in this connection are the problems which may be encountered
during and following long-term exposure to weightlessness.
Although there is no evidence of adverse effects on operative behavior,
the possibility of biological disturbances on a cellular or subcellular
level, which may cause a deterioration of the somatic basis, has been
repeatedly stressed. Whether effects of this sort will occur or whether
the organism will be able to adapt is still an open question. Since motion
sensitivity based on vestibular stimulation differs widely among individuals,
the selection of astronauts may solve the problem of zero-g vestibular
disturbance. Reports from the MA-8 (Sigma 7) and Vostok III and IV
flights seem to support this assumption. Moreover, experiments are
being made in the slow rotation room at the Naval School of Aviation
Medicine to study the Coriolis effects which arise when "artificial gravity"
is produced by angular acceleration. Since man can adapt to wave
motion on shipboard within a few days, a similar process may be expected
to occur in the case of long-term weightlessness (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-150" id="id156">[ref.150]</a>).</p>

this program has been placed on qualitative and theoretical rather than
purely descriptive research, and the investigation of fundamental biological

<div class="level-3 section" id="molecular-biology">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY</h3>
<p class="pfirst">Research in molecular biology has included chemical, physical, biological,
and theoretical investigations of prebiological conditions on
Earth and, possibly, on other planets; studies of cellular inclusions;
genetic material (DNA and RNA) and coding; as well as energy transfer
in biological systems.</p>
<p class="pnext">The understanding of prebiological conditions on Earth, and possible
conditions on other planets, depends upon the nature of the complex
chemical species which might be encountered. Scientists have shown
that biologically important compounds, such as amino acids, can be
generated by applying an electrical discharge, ultraviolet radiation, or
heat to a gaseous mixture. Biologically interesting compounds can be
removed from such a system by condensation or absorption; however, in
the limited time and space available in such experiments, many compounds
are not produced in sufficient quantity to be measured.</p>
<p class="pnext">The National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) and the
National Bureau of Standards (NBS) are conducting an investigation on
equilibria in multielement systems. The distribution of molecular
species at equilibrium is independent of the way equilibrium was reached
and is dependent only on pressure, temperature, and elemental composition.
<span class="pageno target" title="58" id="page-58"> </span>Many of the conditions which might have arisen naturally can be
approximated by thermodynamic equilibrium. Compounds which can
be formed at equilibrium need no special mechanism to explain their
presence. However, special mechanisms have to be sought for those
compounds which could not be so produced and which would have been
required for the structure and nutrition of the first living organisms.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the absence of precise knowledge of the composition of the primitive
planetary atmospheres, equilibrium concentrations with a wide range
of temperatures, pressures, and elemental compositions are being investigated
by NBRF and NBS. These investigators have postulated that the
maximum atmospheric pressure may have approached 100 atm if the
primitive Earth was sufficiently hot and if an appreciable portion of the
water on Earth's surface today was present on primitive Earth. (If the
present oceans were to evaporate, the surface pressure would be <span class="target" id="approximately-300-atm">approximately
300 atm.)</span> Low pressures of 10<sup>-6</sup> atm and temperatures between
500° and 1000° K are being used.</p>
<p class="pnext">A large range of N, O, C, and H compositions are being investigated
for interesting and plausible combinations of factors. In these calculations
an IBM 7090 computer is being used to obtain data on a very large
number of combinations of chemicals. Other chemical species will be
added as the research continues. Some results of this study give an insight
into the variety of biologically significant chemicals which might have
existed during Earth's primitive prebiological condition or may now
exist on the surfaces and in the atmospheres of other planets (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-151" id="id157">[ref.151]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-153" id="id158">[ref.153]</a>).
The general method described by White et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-152" id="id159">[ref.152]</a>), minimizing
the free energy of the system, was used. The solution was approached by
an iterative process, starting with an initial guess of concentrations of
the compounds. At each step, <em class="italics">M</em>+1 linear equations are solved where
<em class="italics">M</em> is the number of elements in the system.</p>
<p class="pnext">In addition to listing of the concentrations of all compounds included
in each problem, the results of three-element problems have been
expressed on a triangular composition diagram for convenience. A
coarse grid of 60 points is used to survey all elemental compositions, with
finer grids being used in regions of particular interest. The calculated
concentrations of the compounds at each composition are stored, and
finally a series of triangular diagrams is printed out, each showing the
concentrations of as many as four compounds at the grid points.</p>
<p class="pnext">Figure 2 shows the results obtained in the C, H, and O systems.
Organic compounds in concentrations greater than 10<sup>-20</sup> mole fraction
are found everywhere except where free O<sub>2</sub>, is present. Solid carbon
theoretically becomes stable along the lower dashed line at 500° K.
However, reactions producing it are very slow. The supersaturated
region beyond the line of potential carbon formation was also investigated.
A threshold was found where polynuclear aromatic compounds
are sufficiently concentrated to form a liquid phase. These conditions
may have been involved in the primordial formation of asphaltic
petroleum.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Jukes and associates (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-154" id="id160">[ref.154]</a>) at the University of California at
Berkeley have been investigating the code for amino acids in protein
synthesis, the key for translating the sequence of bases in DNA into the
sequence of amino acids in proteins. The amino acid code was solely a
matter of theory until Nirenberg and Matthaei (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-155" id="id161">[ref.155]</a>) at the National
Institutes of Health carried out a crucial experiment. This experiment
bridged the last remaining gap separating theoretical genetics and test-tube
<span class="pageno target" title="60" id="page-60"> </span>biochemistry. It now became experimentally possible to search for
codes for all 20 amino acids concerned in the synthesis of proteins.</p>
<p class="pnext">The amino acid bases of DNA are: A, adenine; C, cytosine; G, guanine;
T, thymine; and U, uracil, which replaces thymine in RNA. There
are only 16 ways of arranging A, C, G, and T in pairs. For this and other
reasons it is thought that a triplet of three consecutive bases is needed to
code for each amino acid. The sequences of bases in a strand of DNA
are known to be unrestricted with respect to the order in which they
occur; apparently any one of the four bases can be next to any of the
other four, although, of course, each base must be paired with the corresponding
complementary base in the adjacent strand. Since the same
freedom is true of the amino acid sequences in the polypeptide chains
of proteins, any one of the 20 amino acids can occur next to any other.
Moreover, the sequences in DNA are subject to mutational changes in
which one base replaces another, or bases are added to or deleted from
the DNA. Such rearrangements plus the possibility of lengthening of
DNA molecules are numerous enough to account for all the genetics of
living forms since the first appearance of life on Earth.</p>
<p class="pnext">Most of our knowledge is based on experiments with synthetic RNA
carried out with extracts of <em class="italics">E. coli</em>. The majority of the work has been
at Nirenberg's laboratory at the National Institutes of Health and at
Ochoa's laboratory at New York University (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-155" id="id162">[ref.155]</a>). Various combinations
of A, C, G, and U were used in preparing the synthetic RNA molecules
that are used in experiments to explore the code. These molecules
are made by incubating a mixture of ribonucleoside diphosphates with
a specific enzyme, polynucleotide phosphorylase. An important property
of this enzyme is that it condenses the nucleoside diphosphates into
polynucleotide strands containing random sequences depending on the
proportion of each base. For example, if the enzyme were furnished
with a mixture of 5 parts of A and 1 part of C, it would make strands
containing, on the average, 25 sequences of AAA, 5 of AAC, 5 of ACA,
5 of CAA, and 1 each of ACC, CAC, and CCA. The proportion of
triplets within the strands of a polynucleotide is reflected in the proportion
of amino acids in polypeptides that are obtained in the cell-free
system. Most of the present knowledge of the amino acid code is based
on this concept. All the proposed codes have been discovered by this
experimental approach where synthetic RNA molecules are used as
"artificial" messenger RNA.</p>
<p class="pnext">Representative of another class of activities in molecular biology is the
examination of passive ion flux across axon membranes. This work is
being done by Goldman at the National Naval Medical Center. The
question of stimulus transmission by nerve tissue is far from simple, and
<span class="pageno target" title="61" id="page-61"> </span>the ion concentrations associated with nerve membranes is a significant
part of the answer. Because the space environment may very well produce
alterations in these ion potentials, an investigation of their natures
and significance becomes extremely important. A working theory is now
being developed as a result of this study.</p>
<p class="pnext">Vital cell processes, chemical transformations, and mechanisms that
provide energy for cell maintenance and activity have been studied by
Kiesow (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-157" id="id163">[ref.157]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-158" id="id164">[ref.158]</a>) at the Naval Medical Research Institute.
The common objective of all phases of this project is the elucidation of
reaction steps in which energy and matter are transformed in living
systems. Compared with <em class="italics">photo</em>synthetic organisms, <em class="italics">chemo</em>synthetic
bacteria offer distinct advantages for the study of energy assimilation.
These studies have led to the following experimental findings.</p>
<p class="pnext">With the energy from oxidation of nitrite, NO<sub>2</sub>— to nitrate, NO<sub>3</sub>— as
an <em class="italics">inorganic</em> source, and with added <em class="italics">organic</em> chemical energy from the
hydrolysis of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) to adenosinediphosphate
(ADP) and inorganic phosphate, chemosynthetic bacteria are capable of
reducing diphosphopyridinenucleotide (DPN<sup>+</sup>) to DPNH, in a coupled
oxidoreduction-dephosphorylation. Thus, in the crucial step of chemosynthesis,
<em class="italics">ATP is consumed, not produced</em>. However, in simultaneously
proceeding cell respiration, the energy donor, DPNH, is oxidized and
generates more ATP than is required for DPN<sup>+</sup> reduction. This
"breeder cycle" for DPNH—with different ratios of cell respiration and
biosynthesis—results in a net production of either DPNH, or ATP, or
both. Production of DPNH in the cycle leads immediately to the assimilation
of C<sup>14</sup> from HC<sup>14</sup>O<sub>3</sub>—. These observations explain the bacteria's
energy source without the classical hypotheses of either direct phosphorylation
or direct CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by inorganic chemical or electromagnetic
energy. The cycle transforms the free energy of nitrite oxidation
into the free energy of the organic compounds. Cell respiration and
elementary biosynthesis proceed through structure-bound enzyme systems
in the same fraction of subcellular particles. Three components, two
cytochromes and one flavoprotein, have been identified. A thermodynamic
analysis of the DPNH "breeder cycle" appears to be attainable
by measurements of redox potentials and calorimetric determinations of
heats of reaction.</p>
<p class="pnext">Studies are also being conducted by Pollard and associates at Pennsylvania
State University in an attempt to formulate a theoretical basis for
the description of the processes of synthesis, growth, division, and
differentiation of the living cell. Such a theory would be basic to an
understanding of very primitive life forms or prebiological material
<span class="pageno target" title="62" id="page-62"> </span>which might be found elsewhere in the universe. For these purposes,
studies are being undertaken in macromolecular reproduction which
differ from the studies involving cellular genetic material. Theories
concerning the problem of replication of cellular structures and information
storage in two-dimensional systems are being developed. Theories
are also being developed about the mechanisms which control and
regulate receptor and enzymatic activities within the cell.</p>
<p class="pnext">One study involved the rate of mutation in cells and disposed of the
suggestion that the process of mutation consists of a "tunneling" of
proton from one base to another in DNA. Such a suggestion can no
longer be advanced as a major explanation of mutations.</p>
<p class="pnext">Work is also being conducted on the centrifugation of cells of <em class="italics">E. coli</em>.
It has been shown that cells exposed to as little as 100 g have a modification
in their function. This has been looked at from the point of view
of thymine uptake, which would be concerned with the formation of
DNA, and also from the point of view of the induction of an enzyme,
which would correspond to the transcription of the DNA. Preliminary
experiments in the latter case indicate considerable centrifugation effect.
The thymine uptake is affected, but not nearly as much as formerly
thought. Further work is in progress in this area.</p>
<p class="pnext">Important work has been completed on the cells of <em class="italics">E. coli</em> grown on
maltose, which can be induced to produce betagalactosidase by the addition
of thiomethyl galactoside. If cells are irradiated shortly after induction,
the transcription of the DNA ceases and the enzyme produced by
the messenger RNA is observed to reach a maximum. This enables the
calculation of the half-life of unstable messenger RNA. The half-life
for this decay is readily measurable, and values are given over a temperature
range of 17° C (5.2 minimum) to 45° C (0.56 minimum). These
agree very well with half-lives measured by others by inducing for
short times and measuring the course of enzyme formation. The rate of
transcription is involved in the kinetics of cessation of enzyme induction,
and the rate of transcription can be measured. Arrhenius plots for this
rate and the rate of decay are given, and the activation energies measured
are about 16 000 cal/mole. The cessation of transcription is linked to
the degradation, possibly of only one strand, of DNA.</p>
<p class="pnext">Pollard has suggested that one important action of ionizing radiation
is concerned with the transcription of the genetic message into RNA.
Clayton and Adler (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-159" id="id165">[ref.159]</a>) showed that induced catalase synthesis in
<em class="italics">Rhodopseudomonas spheroides</em> is inhibited by low doses of X-rays, giving
experimental support to the idea. Pollard and Vogler (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-160" id="id166">[ref.160]</a>), using
cells in which the process of induction involved permease, showed that
there is some sensitivity to gamma radiation. Novelli et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-161" id="id167">[ref.161]</a>)
<span class="pageno target" title="63" id="page-63"> </span>found a reduced sensitivity as compared with colony formation, but it is
still a considerable sensitivity.</p>
<p class="pnext">The process of induction of an enzyme indicates that the transcription
of the genetic message is repressed by something which can be acted on by
a small molecule, the inducer, to remove repression and permit the
formation of messenger RNA, which then acts to make the enzyme. The
messenger RNA undergoes decay through a process which is still not
clear. Very elegant measurements by Kepes (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-162" id="id168">[ref.162]</a>) show that for the
messenger RNA for betagalactosidase, the half-life is 1.02 min at 37° C
and 2.05 min at 25° C. The time of onset of enzyme formation after
induction was found to be about 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="pnext">If the process of transcription is indeed sensitive to ionizing radiation,
then the irradiation of cells which have just been induced should show
formation of the enzyme to the extent of formation of new messenger
RNA within a few minutes, plus the formation of the enzyme while the
messenger RNA is decaying. This pattern was found by Clayton and
Adler. The experiments conducted by Pollard and associates amplify
and extend their work and also agree with the work of Kepes (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-162" id="id169">[ref.162]</a>).</p>

<p class="pfirst">Fernandez-Moran (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-163" id="id170">[ref.163]</a>-<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-165" id="id171">[ref.165]</a>), at the University of Chicago, has
devised a new multielectrode electrostatic lens which he has incorporated
into an electron microscope. This necessitated the development of a
novel high-voltage power source and voltage regulator of extreme
stability and accuracy. Some promising work has now been done on
superconducting lenses. In a series of experiments with a simple electron
microscope without pole pieces, using high-field superconducting
niobium-zirconium solenoid lenses in an open air core, liquid helium
Dewar, electron microscopic images of test specimens have been recorded
while operating at 32 200 gauss in a persistent current mode, with regulated
accelerating potentials of 4 to 8 kilovolts. These preliminary
experiments have demonstrated the exceptional stability of the images
(both short term and long term) over a period of 4 to 8 hours and the
relatively high quality of the images.</p>
<p class="pnext">Progress has been made on the viscosimeter for high intrinsic
viscosities. This is now working, and the viscosity of DNA preparations
has been measured. It is hoped to use the viscosimeter to study the variation
in DNA viscosity as a function of the cell cycle.</p>
<p class="pnext">An instrument is under development by Wald at the University of
Pittsburgh to automatically analyze cytogenetic material and, thus,
extend cytogenetic methodology both for research and as a biological
monitoring procedure, using automatic electronic scanning and
<span class="pageno target" title="64" id="page-64"> </span>computer analysis of chromosomes. Chromosomal aberrations can thus be
monitored under unusual and abnormal conditions such as weightlessness
and radiation, since chromosomes are very sensitive to stress situations.
In this device a sample will be prepared and automatically inserted under
a microscope lens. The device will then scan, identify, and photograph
on 35-mm film a predetermined number of mitotic cells and process the
film. The data will be recorded under the direct control of a digital
computer. The computer will perform a detailed quantitative analysis
of the pictorial data.</p>
<p class="pnext">Significant effort has been expended in the development of instrumentation
for measuring and recording electrophysiological information.
One such instrument, developed by the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia,
Pa., is a temperature-sensing microprobe. This microprobe is an
implantable and remote broadcasting instrument. These developments
are associated, in part, with training programs so that competent
individuals may be trained not only in electronics but also in the biological
uses of the devices they construct.</p>
<p class="pnext">A project of interest, conducted at the Stanford Research Institute, is
the investigation of the uses of an extremely sensitive method for measuring
magnetic susceptibility having the possibility of detecting macroscopic
quantum effects in macromolecules of biological interest. Good
progress has been made in the first 15 months of a project devoted to the
development and initial use of equipment specifically designed for this
purpose. A new superconducting circuit, together with superconducting
magnetic shields, has been constructed. This apparatus can measure
the magnetic susceptibility of small organic samples at temperatures
between 1° and 300° K in fields up to 40 000 gauss. It can detect flux
changes of 10<sup>7</sup> gauss-cm<sup>2</sup>, which is equivalent to detecting a change in
specific susceptibility of 1 in 10<sup>9</sup> in a 100-mg sample under an applied
field of 10 000 gauss.</p>
<p class="pnext">Several hundred preliminary measurements were made on samples of
coronene. The most reliable of these were in agreement with published
values of the magnetic susceptibility of coronene. Experience during
these measurements led to changes which have resulted in an apparatus
well suited to the measurements on macromolecules. An improved version
of the superconducting circuit now available shows promise of a
further improvement in sensitivity by a factor of more than a thousand
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-166" id="id172">[ref.166]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">Living organisms possess many unique processes and systems which
are complex and poorly understood. The new theoretical approaches,
combined with laboratory studies, are expected to result in advances
which will expand both our scientific and technological horizons.</p>

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">BALLOONS</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">B</span><span class="dropspan small-caps">iological and medical experiments</span> carried out on balloon flights,
both manned and unmanned, antedate the establishment of NASA.
Aside from the early use of balloons in flights that could be called simply
flight-survival studies, balloons have made important contributions to
our present knowledge of the effects of cosmic radiation and to various
aspects of space travel.</p>
<p class="pnext">The achievements of the Strato-Lab and Man High series by the U.S.
Navy and Air Force include a wealth of information on balloon travel and
on the survival of man at altitudes close to and above 100 000 feet. Generally,
balloon launches of animals, which reached a maximum in 1953
when 23 balloons were released, have established the feasibility of a
program of extended manned balloon flights to high altitudes.</p>
<p class="pnext">Atmospheric life studies outside the area of cosmic radiation effects
have been comparatively few. Results from two manned flights, Strato-Lab
I and II, indicate that the flights did produce pronounced changes
in white blood cell count; however, the data suggest that these changes
were due to psychological rather than physical stress. Exposure to
altitudes above 90 000 feet for a total of 62 hours did not produce any
general behavioral change in two Java monkeys, according to other balloon
flights. Many of these flights were effective in testing equipment,
telemetering devices, and in pointing the way for other flights.</p>
<p class="pnext">Stratoscope I and II, originally undertaken by the Office of Naval
Research (ONR), are projects involving various astronomical observations
with the aid of a balloon-borne telescope and television and
camera systems. NASA cooperated with ONR on Stratoscope II (36-inch
telescope compared with Stratoscope I's 12-inch telescope) which has
<span class="pageno target" title="66" id="page-66"> </span>already resulted in significant discoveries about the nature of the planets
and stars. Water vapor has been identified in the atmosphere of cool red
stars and an analysis of the Martian spectra showed a greater abundance
of carbon dioxide than had previously been believed. Since the balloon-borne
telescope was carried beyond Earth's obscuring atmosphere, the
Stratoscope projects have yielded valuable photographs of the Sun, stars,
and various planets.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="rockets-and-satellites">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">ROCKETS AND SATELLITES</h3>
<p class="pfirst">Historically, biological experiments aboard rockets and satellites have
been limited to a "piggyback" and "noninterference" basis on military
rockets. For the past few years, however, as the effort toward manned
space flight leading to lunar and Martian landings increased, more attention
was devoted to experiments designed to show the effects of the space
environment on living systems. As in the balloon flight programs, the
U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force played an important role, reaching
what might be considered a high point with the successful launch and
recovery of a ballistic rocket experiment with monkeys Able and Baker.
Aerobee rockets as well as Thor IRBM's carried biological payloads
consisting of mice and monkeys on six launches, contributing to our
knowledge of the effects of weightlessness and radiation on higher
animals.</p>
<p class="pnext">Van der Wal and Young (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-78" id="id173">[ref.78]</a>) used Thor-Able combinations to
serve as boosters for lifting a 20-pound biocapsule to a peak altitude of
1400 miles and over a distance of about 5300 miles from Cape Canaveral
to the west coast of Africa. Weightlessness was attained for a period of
almost 40 minutes. During reentry into the atmosphere, a peak deceleration
of about 60 g was reached. Each of the three capsules flown carried
one mouse (Mouse-in-Able); two of the mice were instrumented for
heart-rate telemetry. Although all three mice were lost, the two experiments
with Laska and Benji yielded physiological results.</p>
<p class="pnext">The experimenters designed effective instrumentation for registering
the electrical activity of the mouse's heart through a single commutated
telemetry channel. Records were obtained for both animals during
various portions of the flight. The results indicate that both animals
were alive when the nose cones hit the water.</p>
<p class="pnext">Two South American squirrel monkeys (Gordo and Baker) and a
rhesus monkey (Able) were launched into space from Cape Canaveral in
1958 and 1959 by U.S. Army Jupiter missiles. The vehicles reached
speeds of approximately 10 000 mph and altitudes of 300 miles on flights
which lasted about 15 min.</p>
<p class="pnext">Time courses of cardiac and respiratory rates (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-80" id="id174">[ref.80]</a>) of the two
<span class="pageno target" title="67" id="page-67"> </span>squirrel monkeys showed that the noise of the engine at liftoff immediately
produced an increase in their heart rates. Respiration also increased
temporarily, but slowed later with increasing acceleration. Heart rates
fluctuated considerably during launch acceleration, which reached about
15 g at cutoff.</p>
<p class="pnext">The period of free flight and weightlessness was characterized by pronounced
fluctuations of heart activity in the postacceleration phase.
Thereafter, the heart rate of Baker remained relatively constant, whereas
the cardiac activity of Gordo fluctuated markedly and decreased slowly
almost to the end of his flight. Slight changes, which were transient and
not pathological in nature, were also noted in the electrocardiogram.
Gordo's respiration was very shallow during maximum launch acceleration,
when Baker's reached its highest value, only to be approximated
again during reentry when forces of about 35 g were encountered.</p>
<p class="pnext">Able's cardiac and respiratory rates indicated that, after an initial
startle reaction, the heart rate dropped transiently and then increased
steeply, reaching a maximum of 259 during the 10-second interval at
peak acceleration. Respiration increased only slightly throughout the
launching phase. There was a period of tachycardia during postacceleration
weightlessness, after which the heart rate declined steadily and was
disturbed only by several startling missile events. At the end of the
subgravity phase, Able's cardiac rate was slightly below normal.</p>
<p class="pnext">Although the periods of high g force and free flight were short, the
extremes were considerable, and the changes from one state to the next
were rapid. In spite of this, the cardiovascular, hemodynamic, and
electrocardiographic phenomena were remarkably well maintained.
Apparently the animals were not in serious plight at any time. That
psychological factors entered into the observed phenomena is clearly
evident from the increase in cardiac rate associated with the noise of the
engine prior to liftoff and also from the cinematographic record of facial
expressions. Nevertheless, the integrated responses indicated that the
animals' physiological states remained sufficiently normal to insure a
safe flight.</p>

<div class="level-3 section" id="little-joe-flights">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">LITTLE JOE FLIGHTS</h3>
<p class="pfirst">The first step in an attempt at animal verification of the adequacy of
the Mercury flight program was the development of two tests by NASA
in collaboration with the U.S. Air Force School of Aviation Medicine in
which there would be a biomedical evaluation of the accelerations
experienced during the abort of a Mercury flight at and shortly after
liftoff. These flights were launched at the NASA Wallops Station with
a Little Joe solid-fuel launch vehicle.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="68" id="page-68"> </span>Two Little Joe launches were made with activation of the escape
rockets during the boost phase to secure maximum acceleration; only a
brief period of weightlessness was attained. The first launch was on
December 4, 1959, and the other on January 21, 1960. A 36 by 18-inch
sealed, 125-pound, cylindrical capsule containing the subject, an 8-pound
<em class="italics">Macaca mulatta</em>, the necessary life-support system, and associated instrumentation
was flown in a "boilerplate" model of the Mercury spacecraft.
The rhesus monkeys were named "Sam" and "Miss Sam."</p>
<p class="pnext">The flight profile included maximum accelerations of about 10 to 12 g
and periods of about 3 minutes at 0±0.02 g. The peak altitude obtained
in the last ballistic flight was about 280 000 feet. The experimental
capsule was pressurized at 1 atmosphere with 100 percent oxygen at the
start of the experiment and fell to just below a half atmosphere of oxygen
due to breathing during flight. The capsule temperature was kept
between 10° and 20° C in both flights.</p>
<p class="pnext">The measurements taken from the rhesus monkeys were the electrocardiogram,
respiration, body temperature, eye movements, and bar
pressing, but only partial results were obtained in the first flight. Oxygen
tension, total pressure, capsule temperature, and relative humidity were
recorded. Both animals were recovered alive and did not show pathologic
alterations in their physiologic and psychological reactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="mercury-animal-test-flights">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">MERCURY ANIMAL TEST FLIGHTS</h3>
<p class="pfirst">In the Mercury animal test program a Redstone missile carried the
chimpanzee Ham on a ballistic flight to a height of 155 miles to provide
animal verification of the success with which the Mercury system could
be applied to manned flight. The male chimpanzee was trained to
perform a two-phased reaction task during the 16 minutes of flight. The
chimpanzee Enos was put into orbit for 3 hours and 20 minutes. Results
of the two flights gave the following information:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">Pulse and respiration rates during both the ballistic (MR-2) and
the orbital (MA-5) flights remained within normal limits
throughout the weightless state. Effectiveness of heart action,
as evaluated from the electrocardiograms and pressure records,
was also unaffected by the flights.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Blood pressures, both arterial and venous, were not significantly
changed from preflight values during 3 hours of the weightless
state.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">The performance of a series of tasks involving continuous and
discrete avoidance, fixed ratio responses for food reward, delayed
response for a fluid reward, and solution of a simple oddity
problem was unaffected by the weightless state.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Animals <span class="pageno target" title="69" id="page-69"> </span>trained in the laboratory to perform during simulated
acceleration, noise, and vibration of launch and reentry were
able to maintain performance throughout an actual flight.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">From the results of the MR-2 and MA-5 flights, the following conclusions
were drawn:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">The numerous objectives of the Mercury animal test program were
met. The MR-2 and MA-5 tests preceded the first ballistic and
orbital manned flights, respectively, and provided valuable
training in countdown procedures and range monitoring and
recovery techniques. The bioinstrumentation was effectively
tested and the adequacy of the environmental control system
was demonstrated.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">A 7-minute (MR-2) and a 3-hour (MA-5) exposure to the weightless
state were experienced by the subjects in an experimental
design which left visual and tactile references unimpaired.
There was no significant change in the physiological state or
performance of the animals as measured during a series of tasks
of graded motivation and difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Questions were answered concerning the physical and mental
demands that the astronauts would encounter during space
flight, and it was shown that these demands would not be
excessive.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">It was also demonstrated that the young chimpanzee can be
trained to be a highly reliable subject for space-flight studies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">The suborbital ballistic flight of Ham on January 31, 1961, was the
prelude to Alan R. Shepard's suborbital space flight, while the orbital
flight of Enos on November 29, 1961, preceded the orbital flight of
John H. Glenn.</p>
<p class="pnext">The fact that we now categorize these events as belonging to the
rather distant past, although they occurred only about 4 years ago, serves
to emphasize the pace of development in the exploration of space.
While the chimpanzee program may pale in the light of subsequent
successes, its scientific and technological contribution should not be
overlooked.</p>
<p class="pnext">The significance of this project can be fully appreciated, and its contribution
judged, only by considering the lack of knowledge existing at
the time of its conception. In addition to its essential training function,
this project verified the feasibility of manned space flight through operational
tests of the Mercury life-support system. It demonstrated that
complex behavioral processes and basic physiological functions remained
essentially unperturbed during brief exposures to space flight. The
Mercury chimpanzee program marked the first time that physiological
<span class="pageno target" title="70" id="page-70"> </span>and behavioral assessment techniques were combined for evaluating the
functional efficiency of the total organism in space.</p>
<p class="pnext">Perhaps the ultimate contribution of this program was in providing
the framework of knowledge upon which future scientific experiments
on biological organisms, exposed to flights of extended durations, must
be based. Biosatellite experiments designed to seek more subtle and
elusive effects of prolonged space flight on biological functioning will
require even more refined and difficult techniques, but will depend
heavily on the groundwork laid in these early steps of Project Mercury.</p>
<p class="pnext">A summary of the more important animal suborbital and orbital flights
during the period 1957 to 1964 is presented in <a class="reference internal pginternal" href="#table-vii">table VII</a>.</p>
<p class="pnext">In another NASA-supported flight, <span class="small-caps">NERV</span> 1, various experiments were
carried in a suborbital flight of 20 minutes. <em class="italics">Neurospora</em> molds showed
a surprisingly high level of mutation, but the control molds also had high
rates.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Discoverer XVII and XVIII flights, to which the Air Force contributed,
resulted in many interesting findings relative to the responses of
living systems to space flight. On the Discoverer XVII flight, samples of
human gamma globulin and rabbit antiserum specific for human gamma
globulin showed an increase in reactivity, and samples of synovial and
conjunctival cells showed no changes in their cytological characteristics.</p>
<p class="pnext">Discoverer XVIII was launched during a massive solar flare which
lasted for the first 13 hours of the 48-orbit, 3-day flight. <em class="italics">Neurospora
conidia</em>, nerve tissue, algae, human bone marrow, eyelid tissue, gamma
globulin, and cancer cells were put in orbit. The results indicated that
biological specimens may be able to withstand radiation from solar flares
with a minimum of shielding and that aluminum shielding may be better
than lead.</p>
<p class="pnext">In 1949, the U.S.S.R. began a systematic, uninterrupted research program
in biological space experimentation. They have studied the effects
of physical stress, immune reactions, psychobiology and behavior,
genetics, and responses to environmental factors such as spacecraft
dynamics and ambient radiation. The organisms and biological materials

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span class="pageno target" title="72" id="page-72"> </span>THE NASA BIOSATELLITE PROGRAM<a class="footnote-reference pginternal" href="#id178" id="id177"><sup>3</sup></a></h3>
<p class="pfirst">The space environment offers a unique opportunity to study the basic
properties of living Earth organisms with new tools and opens up new
areas of research for which biological theory fails to provide adequate
predictions. Unique components of the space environment of biological
importance are weightlessness or greatly decreased gravity, the imposition
of an environment disconnected from Earth's 24-hour rotation (particularly
its effect on biorhythms), and cosmic radiation with energies and
particle sizes unmatched by anything produced artificially on Earth
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-169" id="id180">[ref.169]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">As progress is made in the manned exploration of space, the biological
effects of its unique environmental factors become of greater importance.
It is essential to determine the effects of space environment on man's
ability to perform physical and mental tasks. In addition, it is necessary
to develop those systems required for his survival and for his physiological
and psychological well-being, both in space and in his subsequent resumption
of normal life patterns. Despite nearly a century of research and
development in environmental physiology, a number of phenomena will
be encountered in long-term space flight with which we have had neither
the experience that would enable us to predict the effects nor to develop
the necessary protective or remedial measures (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-170" id="id181">[ref.170]</a>). Many of the
experimental programs in bioscience are being carried out or planned so
that the deleterious effects of these phenomena may be determined, predicted,
or avoided before they are encountered in manned flight.</p>
<p class="pnext">Biological experimentation has been carried out in orbiting spacecraft
by Soviet and American scientists preparatory to manned space flight.
These first-generation exploratory experiments had the following
objectives:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">To discover whether complex organisms could survive space conditions
and to test life-support systems</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">To determine whether complex organisms (dogs and primates)
could survive launch, orbital space flight, reentry, and recovery</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">To determine the effects of space radiation and any obvious effects
of weightlessness on biological organisms</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">These biological studies indicate that manned space flight was practicable,
and the various cosmonaut and astronaut flights have proven the
validity of the results.</p>
<p class="pnext">The National Academy of Sciences' Space Science Board summer study
(<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-171" id="id182">[ref.171]</a>) recommended that—</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="pfirst">NASA should exploit special features of the space environment as unique situations
<span class="pageno target" title="73" id="page-73"> </span>for the general analysis of the organism-environment relationships including, especially,
the role environmental inputs play in the establishment and maintenance of
normal organization in the living system. NASA should support studies in ground-based
and in orbiting laboratories [biosatellites] on the biological effects of gravity
fields both above and below normal. This should be considered a major responsibility
of NASA in the area of environmental opportunities. NASA should support studies
of biological rhythms in plants and animals including man as part of its effort in
environmental biology. Investigate by observation of rhythms in organisms in space
in (<em class="italics">a</em>) polar and equatorial low orbits; (<em class="italics">b</em>) orbits less than, equal to and greater than
22,000 miles. Properly designed experiments should be conducted to explore the effects
of different environmental factors when these impinge simultaneously on test organisms.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">The Panel on Gravity of the Space Science Board (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-67" id="id183">[ref.67]</a>) stated that
the major effects of low gravity would be expected in heterocellular
organisms that develop in more or less fixed orientation with respect to
terrestrial gravity and which respond to changes in orientation with
relatively long induction periods, including the higher plants. On the
other extreme are the complex primates which respond rapidly, but
whose multiplicity of organs and correlative mechanisms make the
occurrence of malfunction and disorganization probable, but not certain.
The Panel recommended emphasis on early embryogenesis and histogenesis,
particularly of plants during exposure to low gravity, and
anatomical studies after low gravity. They stated that perturbations of
the environment to which the experimental organism is exposed must
be limited or controlled to reduce uncertainties in interpretation of
results. At the same time, the introduction of known perturbations may
assist in isolating the effects due solely to gravity. Ground-based clinostats
and centrifuges should be used in conjunction with the experiments,
and an attempt should be made to extrapolate effects of low gravity with
the clinostat.</p>
<p class="pnext">The study of the effects of unique or unknown space environmental
factors will probably yield unexpected results which may drastically
modify future technical approaches. The results from these biosatellite
studies will have broad application to longer term, manned space flight,
including manned space stations and lunar and planetary exploration.</p>
<p class="pnext">The biosatellite program is a second-generation series of carefully
planned and selected experiments, including some highly sophisticated
experiments which have required several years of baseline study and
equipment development. These orbiting recoverable biosatellites will
provide opportunities for critical testing of major biological hypotheses
in the areas of genetics, evolution, and physiology.</p>
<p class="pnext">The scientific community showed great interest in the biosatellite
program, and scientists from universities, industry, and Government
have submitted 185 flight experiments involving primates and other
<span class="pageno target" title="74" id="page-74"> </span>mammals, vertebrate and invertebrate animals, micro-organisms, and
plants.</p>
<p class="pnext">The selected biosatellite experiments include studies at the cellular,
tissue, and organism levels, including embryological development and
growth experiments at the tissue level and physiological, behavioral,
reproductive, and genetic studies at the organism level. The experiments
are divided into six categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">Primates</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Mammals (nonprimate)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Animal, cellular, and egg</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Plant morphogenesis, photosynthesis, and growth</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Biorhythm</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">Radiation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">Twenty experiments have been selected for flight to study the effects of
weightlessness and decreased gravity during 3- to 30-day orbital periods.
The experiments include a wide variety of plants and animals from
single-celled organisms to higher plants and animals. The effects of
weightlessness on the primate will be studied, especially the central
nervous, the cardiovascular, and the skeletal systems during 30-day orbits.</p>
<p class="pnext">Experiments have been selected to study the genetic and somatic effects
of weightlessness combined with a known source of radiation (Sr<sup>85</sup>) to
determine if there are any antagonistic or synergistic effects (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-172" id="id184">[ref.172]</a>).
Experiments are also included for studying the effects of the unique
environment of the Earth-orbiting satellite and removal from the Earth's
rotation in relation to biological rhythms of plants and animals.</p>
<p class="pnext">Six biosatellites are included in the presently approved program, with
the first flight in 1966. They will be launched from Cape Kennedy by
the improved two-stage, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta into a nearly
equatorial circular orbit at an altitude of 180-200 miles for periods up to
30 days. Recovery will be by Air Force airplane during capsule/parachute
descent. The spacecraft weigh 1000-1200 pounds, have a 280-pound
recoverable capsule and, while in orbit, will not experience
greater than 1/10 000 g of acceleration. The life-support system will
provide an environment at sea-level pressure of 80 percent nitrogen,
20 percent oxygen, and no more than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide with
a temperature of 75° F ±5° F.</p>
<p class="pnext">All experiments are in various stages of development or testing and
flight test hardware has been and is being constructed. The experiments
and hardware are being subjected to preflight tests simulating launch and
recovery stresses. Rhesus, pigtail, and squirrel monkeys have been subjected
to the dynamic forces of the simulated flight under conditions of
complete, partial, and no restraint. Three types of centrifuges have been
used to simulate the flight profile. Primates were fully instrumented with
deep brain electrode implants, implanted catheters, and other implanted
<span class="pageno target" title="75" id="page-75"> </span>sensors. During centrifugation, motion pictures were taken. These
primates were semirestrained in form-fitted couches which allowed movement
of the body while facing the accelerative force in a ventrodorsal
position (eyeballs in). In this series of tests, all primates were normal
following the tests and exhibited no unusual behavior or effects. X-rays
showed that implanted catheters and electrodes remained in place, and
there were no movements causing tissue damage. However, when the
primates were placed with their backs toward the accelerative force,
dorsoventral (eyeballs out), the animals suffered visible damage. At 6 g
there was no visible stress, but at 8 g swelling of the lower eyelids was
noticeable. At 11 g both eyelids were swollen shut. In the biosatellite
program, primates will be placed in the semirestraint couches in a position
facing accelerative forces, ventrodorsal (eyeballs in), to prevent
these effects.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">P</span><span class="dropspan small-caps">lacing a man in space</span> requires a complete life-support system
capable of supplying sufficient oxygen, food, and water and removing
excess carbon dioxide, water vapor, and human body wastes. In addition,
the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pressure must be maintained at a
suitable level. Any accumulated toxic products and noxious odors must
be removed.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the spacecraft the human is confined in a restricted environment in
which it is necessary to establish a balanced microcosm or closed ecological
system. This is an enormous biological and bioengineering problem.
Weight, size, simplicity of operation, and reliability particularly are
important factors.</p>
<p class="pnext">For relatively short missions involving one or several astronauts, food,
oxygen, and water can be stored and made available as required, and the
various waste products can be stored. On longer missions, particularly
those involving more than one astronaut, efficient chemical or biological
regenerative systems will be required. Any regenerative system introduces
a fixed cost in weight of processing equipment and energy
requirements.</p>
<p class="pnext">Chemical, or partially regenerative, methods for providing breathing
oxygen by the regeneration of metabolic products such as water vapor
and carbon dioxide include the thermal decomposition of water and
CO<sub>2</sub>, photolysis and radiolysis of water, electrolysis of fused carbonates
and aqueous solutions, and the chemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>,
followed by electrolysis of the water formed. Chemical regenerative
systems have been developed to remove excess carbon dioxide and water
vapor from the atmosphere. Nonbiological regenerative systems are
time limited by the amount of food, water, and oxygen that can be
carried or recovered. These physical-chemical processes show great
<span class="pageno target" title="78" id="page-78"> </span>potential, but they also present many difficulties, including requirements
for extremely high temperatures and considerable amounts of power,
the formation of highly toxic materials, and high susceptibility to inactivation.
None of the presently studied nonbiological processes can
function as completely as a bioregenerative system. All these nonbiological
systems have unrealistic supply requirements and produce unusable
wastes. Consequently, for long planetary missions the bioregenerative
systems, though also beset with problems, are potentially far superior to
their physical and chemical counterparts.</p>
<p class="pnext"><a class="reference internal pginternal" href="#table-viii">Table VIII</a> shows average daily metabolic data for a 70-kg astronaut.
A man breathes about 10 cubic feet of air per minute, or 400 000 liters,
daily. The expired air contains about 4 percent carbon dioxide. Man
normally breathes air containing 0.03 percent CO<sub>2</sub>, but can withstand
comfortably about 1.5 percent CO<sub>2</sub>. Anything in excess of 1.5
percent will produce labored breathing, headaches, and, if greatly
exceeded, death. A man exhales about 1.1 pounds of water per day and
this, in addition to water from perspiration and other sources, must be
removed from the air.</p>

protein and fat. During this process, carbon dioxide is consumed, and
an approximately equal amount of oxygen gas is liberated. As a first
approximation, photosynthesis is the reverse of the oxidative metabolism
of animal life:</p>

<p class="pfirst">The photosynthetic process in plants and respiration during photosynthesis
have been studied intensively, and several metabolic pathways
have been elucidated. Mechanisms are being studied to explain the
inhibitory effect of strong visible light on this process. This program
may lead to the use of chloroplasts or chlorophyll without cells in future
photosynthetic bioregenerative systems for long-term space travel.</p>
<p class="pnext">One of the prime considerations of a closed ecological system is that
the environmental gases shall remain physiologically tolerable to all of
the ecologic components. Ideally, a photosynthetic gas exchange
organism should possess a high ratio of gas exchange to total mass (considering
all equipment and material incidental to growth, harvesting,
processing, and utilization); and a controllable assimilation rate to maintain
steady-state gas composition. It should also be (1) amenable to confining
quarters which may be imposed by inflexibility of rocket or space
station design; (2) genetically and physiologically stable and highly
resistant to anticipated stresses; (3) edible and capable of supplying most
or all human nutritional requirements; (4) capable of utilizing raw or
appropriately treated organic wastes; and (5) amenable to water recycling
as demanded by other components of the ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="higher-plants">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Higher Plants</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Efforts to utilize multicellular plants as photosynthetic gas exchangers
have been somewhat neglected, since it has been assumed by many that
algae would be more efficient. The family <em class="italics">Lemnaceae</em> (duckweeds) are
small primitive aquatic plants with a minimum of tissue differentiation.
Practically all of the cells of the plant contain chlorophyll and are capable
of photosynthetic activity. They reproduce principally by asexual
budding of parent leaflike fronds. They can be grown readily on moist
surfaces (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-177" id="id197">[ref.177]</a>) on almost any medium suitable for the growth of
autotrophic plants. With duckweeds the problems of gaseous exchange
and harvesting are simplified and the volume of medium can be greatly
decreased as compared with algae.</p>
<p class="pnext">Ney (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-177" id="id198">[ref.177]</a>) obtained a very high gas exchange rate with duckweeds.
Using small cultures under controlled optimal conditions of temperature,
light <span class="target" id="ft-c">(600-1000 ft-c)</span>, and CO<sub>2</sub>, concentration, he estimated that 2.3 m<sup>2</sup> of
frondal surface of duckweed, at a gas exchange rate of 10.8 liters m<sup>2</sup>/hr
<span class="pageno target" title="81" id="page-81"> </span>would provide sufficient gas exchange for one man. This would produce
about 25 grams of dry plant material per hour.</p>
<p class="pnext">A few nutritional studies have been carried out with duckweeds.
Nakamura (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-178" id="id199">[ref.178]</a>) considered <em class="italics">Wolffia</em> as a possible source of food for
space travel and found that it contained carbohydrate 25-60 percent,
protein 8-10 percent, fat 18-20 percent, minerals 6-8 percent (all dry
weights), and vitamins B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, and C, with C the most abundant.</p>
<p class="pnext">One of the desirable features of a duckweed system is that the gas
exchange is direct between the atmosphere and the plant and does not
require dissolving the respiratory gases in a bulky fluid system which
introduces special engineering difficulties in zero- or low-gravity
conditions.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the design of equipment for photosynthetic studies, careful consideration
should be given to the material used in the construction of the
unit. Most plastic materials are subject to photo-oxidative degradation,
with CO as one of the products. When air is recirculated through plastic
tubing and transparent rigid plastics in the presence of light, considerable
quantities of CO are given off. With high-intensity illumination such
as sunlight, a CO buildup of several hundred parts per million is not
uncommon. Also, plant pigments such as the carotenoids and chlorophylls
will react similarly when exposed to light of high intensity. If
the plants die, then CO is released quite rapidly.</p>
<p class="pnext">At Colorado State University the responses of plants to high-intensity
radiation (ultraviolet to infrared) are being studied. Plants from high
mountaintops that are exposed to greater ultraviolet light are being
studied for specialized adaptations. The effect of temperature on photosynthesis
is being explored. Various plants are also being studied under
germ-free conditions.</p>
<p class="pnext">Screening of higher plants for possible use in bioregenerative systems
at Connecticut Agriculture Experiment Station resulted in the selection
of corn, sugarcane, and sunflower. Under optimal conditions it has been
shown that 100 to 130 ft<sup>2</sup> of leaf surface are required to support an
astronaut.</p>
<p class="pnext">Plants considered as possible food sources include soybeans, peanuts,
rice, and tomatoes, which can be combined with algae to give a well-balanced
and reasonably varied diet. Hydroponic systems use large
quantities of water, but progress is being made in reducing this.</p>
<p class="pnext">The possibility of using animals in the closed ecological system is open
to question, particularly in the absence of gravity, and much work
remains to be done on using plant materials as animal food and on the
disposal of wastes. Animals which have been considered are crustaceans,
fish, chickens, rabbits, and goats.</p>

<div class="level-4 section" id="algae">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title"><span class="pageno target" title="82" id="page-82"> </span>Algae</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Algae have the fastest growth rate and are among the most efficient
plants for oxygen and food production. It has been amply demonstrated
by Myers (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-179" id="id200">[ref.179]</a>) and other workers that <em class="italics">Chlorella</em> can be used in a
closed ecological system to maintain animals such as mice and a monkey.
The use of algae for supplying O<sub>2</sub> and food, and for removing CO<sub>2</sub> and
odors has been considered by many authors for use in spacecraft, space
platforms, and for establishing bases on the Moon or Mars.</p>
<p class="pnext">Estimates of total efficiency are based on extrapolated laboratory data
and vary widely, since many different types of data have been used as a
basis for these estimates.</p>
<p class="pnext">The respired air containing about 4-5 percent CO<sub>2</sub> is bubbled into the
<em class="italics">Chlorella</em> culture, at either atmospheric or increased pressure. Air containing
a high percentage of oxygen and saturated with moisture is
released from the algal system.</p>
<p class="pnext">The use of algae for several purposes might require from one to three
separate algal systems. For food production, <em class="italics">Chlorella</em> produces 50
percent protein and 50 percent lipids in high-nitrogen media. In low-nitrogen
media, it produces 85 percent lipids. Proper choice of <em class="italics">Chlorella</em>
strains and media will produce not only the necessary calories but also
the necessary specific nutrients required. Certain strains are more
effective in O<sub>2</sub> production, and others in the use of urine and other wastes.</p>
<p class="pnext">Some of the early estimates, using <em class="italics">Chlorella</em> grown at 25° C, for supplying
these requirements for a single man in space include the following:
168 kg of algal suspension (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-179" id="id201">[ref.179]</a>), 200 kg of algal suspension and 50 kg
of equipment including pumps (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-180" id="id202">[ref.180]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-181" id="id203">[ref.181]</a>), and 100 kg of algal
suspension and 50 cubic feet for equipment and gas exchange (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-182" id="id204">[ref.182]</a>).
Using the blue-green alga <em class="italics">Synechocystis</em>, 600 kg of algal suspension would
be required, according to Gafford and Craft. These estimates are based
on preliminary studies, are quite high, and are not of real practical value.</p>
<p class="pnext">Other studies have indicated an extremely efficient algal system which
offers a real potential for a practical and effective gas exchanger (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-183" id="id205">[ref.183]</a>).
A thermophilic strain of <em class="italics">Chlorella</em> with an optimum growth temperature
of 39° C and an optimum temperature for photosynthesis of about 40° C
can increase its cell mass 10 000-fold per day. When operating at one-half
maximum efficiency, this alga produces 100 times its cell volume of
oxygen per hour. Burk et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-183" id="id206">[ref.183]</a>) state: "Future engineering
development should lead to a space requirement, per adult person, of no
more than 3 to 5 cubic feet of algal culture, equipment, and instrumentation
for adequate purification of air." The requirements of this system
would require additional energy in the form of light and of small
amounts of nitrogenous and mineral material for the algae. The light
<span class="pageno target" title="83" id="page-83"> </span>source used by Burk et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-183" id="id207">[ref.183]</a>) is a tungsten filament quartz lamp
the size of a pencil, which has a long life, produces a luminous flux 5-10
times greater than sunlight on Earth, and operates at a 10-12 percent
light efficiency.</p>
<p class="pnext">Research is being carried out on algal regenerative systems by about
40 or 50 laboratories in the United States. NASA is supporting several
basic studies on photosynthesis, the physiology of algae, and engineering
pilot-plant development. Much of the research on algae is being supported
by the Air Force.</p>
<p class="pnext">Most algal studies have been carried out in small units and the data
obtained have been used as a basis for extrapolating logistic values for
the use of these organisms in manned space vehicles. Myers (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-179" id="id208">[ref.179]</a>)
has shown that the quantity of algae necessary to support a man (with an
assumed O<sub>2</sub> requirement of 625 liters per day) would yield about 600-700
grams dry weight of new cells per day. If algal growth in mass cultures
could be maintained in a steady-state concentration of 2.5 gram dry
weight per liter with such a growth rate as to yield 10 grams weight per
liter per day, the volume of algal culture would be 60-70 liters and the
total mass of the system would approximate 200-250 pounds.</p>
<p class="pnext">Using an 8-liter system, Ward et al. (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-176" id="id209">[ref.176]</a>) have produced algal concentrations
of 5-7 grams of dry algae per liter with a high-temperature
algal strain. The maximum growth rate observed with the culture was
0.375 gram dry weight per liter per hour, or 9 grams dry weight per liter
per day. This was accomplished by using 1-centimeter layers of culture
and a light intensity of 8000 foot-candles. The culture system consisted
of a rectangular plastic chamber having an area of 0.5 square meter and
illuminated on each side to an intensity of 4000 foot-candles (cool-white).
To produce 25 liters of oxygen per hour, an area of 8.3 square meters
(85 square feet) would be required.</p>
<p class="pnext">The major problem in large-scale production of algae is that of
illumination. Conversion of electricity to light has an efficiency of only
10 to 20 percent. In addition, the maximum efficiency of light utilization
by <em class="italics">Chlorella</em> algae lies in the range of 18-22 percent. This results in a
maximum efficiency of only 4 percent for photosynthetic systems.
Another problem involved in conversion of electricity to light is the
production of heat which has to be removed even with thermophilic
algae. With a human demand of 600 liters of oxygen per day, the minimum
electrical requirement becomes 4 kW. No large-scale culture has
yet been managed at anything close to this minimum figure.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another problem is the poor penetration of light into concentrated
cultures of algae. This necessitates construction of large tanks of only
about ¼-inch thickness. This results frequently in fouling of the surfaces
<span class="pageno target" title="84" id="page-84"> </span>of the tank by algae and makes the removal of the excess algae difficult.
Production of 1 liter of oxygen results in the production of 1 gram dry
weight of algae. Although a small amount of CO is produced by some
algae, it can probably be removed by catalytic oxidation. Other problems
include mutation and genetic drift of the algae and the necessity for
maintaining bacteria-free cultures. There are also difficulties in maintaining
a sterile culture if urine is to be used as a nitrogen source. While
there is a potential for using algae as food, more research is required
before it can be determined what quantity and methods of processing
can be used. Research and development on algae is much greater than
on both the higher plants and the electrolysis-<em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas</em> systems
together.</p>
<p class="pnext">The difference between the photosynthetic and electrolysis-chemosynthetic
systems is the way electrical energy is made available to the
organisms. In the photosynthetic system, electrical energy is converted to
light which the algae or plants transform into chemical energy. In the
chemosynthetic process, electrical energy is transformed into the chemical
energy of hydrogen gas which is used by the bacteria. Both organisms use
the chemical energy available to them to synthesize cell material with
similar degrees of efficiency. The problem is to make the conversion of
electricity to available chemical energy as efficient as possible.</p>
<p class="pnext">In photosynthetic systems much energy is lost in the conversion of
electricity to light, a process only 10-20 percent efficient at best. When
this is combined with the loss from the inefficient use of light by plants,
an overall efficiency of about 4 percent is obtained. In the electrolysis-<em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas</em>
system, the two steps are very efficient. Electrolysis
cells can operate at up to 85 percent efficiency and the overall efficiency
can be up to seven times that of a photosynthetic system.</p>

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">ELECTROLYSIS-<em class="italics">HYDROGENOMONAS</em> SYSTEM</h3>
<p class="pfirst">Electrolysis is carried out in a closed unit containing an electrolyte
(KOH solution) with an anode and a cathode. These cells produce a
maximum yield (60-80 percent or more) in gas production per unit of
power consumption. According to Dole and Tamplin (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-184" id="id210">[ref.184]</a>), a unit
capable of producing enough oxygen to sustain one man would be highly
reliable, weigh approximately 18 kg, and require a power input of 0.25
kW.</p>
<p class="pnext">One approach to zero-gravity operation is to rotate the electrolysis
cell as described by Clifford and McCallum (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-185" id="id211">[ref.185]</a>) and Clifford and
Faust (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-186" id="id212">[ref.186]</a>). The smallest known electrolysis cell under development
uses this artificial gravity to separate oxygen from the anode and electrolyte,

would provide breathing oxygen for three men, has a volume of 1.4 liters,
weighs 4.5 kg, and requires 0.67 kW, excluding auxiliary equipment, and
has an efficiency of 84 percent.</p>
<p class="pnext">The chemosynthetic conversion is carried out by the hydrogen bacteria.
By the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, supplied from the electrolysis
of water, energy is made available for biosynthesis. The generation of
this "biological energy" is mediated by the stable enzyme hydrogenase
which is present in the bacteria. On the average, the oxidation of 4
moles of H<sub>2</sub> is required for the conversion of 1 mole of CO<sub>2</sub> (the hourly
production of a man). The removal of this amount of CO<sub>2</sub> would thus
require the cleavage of 4 moles of water. In addition, to supply oxygen
for human respiration (at a rate of 1 mole of O<sub>2</sub> per hour) the cleavage
of two additional moles of water is required. Therefore, the chemosynthetic
regeneration and human respiration together would require, on
the average, the splitting of 6 moles of water per hour.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The effects of temperatures ranging from 20° to 42.5° C on the growth
rates of <em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas eutropha</em> were studied by Bongers (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-189" id="id215">[ref.189]</a>),
and the optimal temperature was found to be about 35° C. Experiments
at 25° and 35° C indicated that the efficiency of energy conversion was
essentially identical at both temperatures. <em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas</em> requires,
as part of its substrate, a mixture of three gases: hydrogen, oxygen, and
carbon dioxide. Experiments were performed by Bongers (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-189" id="id216">[ref.189]</a>) to
determine the toleration limits of the three gases. Growth rates were
found to be identical when hydrogen varied from 5 to 80 percent.
Nearly identical growth was obtained when CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressures were
5 to 60 percent, being slightly lower at higher partial pressures. The
organism was highly sensitive to oxygen concentration. Dissolved oxygen
concentrations above 0.13 mM were found to inhibit cell division;
<span class="pageno target" title="87" id="page-87"> </span>energy utilization was also affected by oxygen concentration. At <span class="target" id="twomm">0.2 mM</span>
oxygen concentration, the efficiency of energy conversion was approximately
half the value observed with 0.05 mM.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another parameter of importance is the total volume of suspension
which would be required to balance the metabolic needs of one man.
The volume of suspension is determined by the conversion capacity of a
unit volume. This capacity is a function of the cell concentration; hence,
the more cells that can be packed in a unit volume of suspension (and
adequately provided with H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>), the less the volume of
suspension required.</p>
<p class="pnext">Results of experiments by Bongers (refs. <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-190" id="id217">[ref.190]</a> and <a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-191" id="id218">[ref.191]</a>) on conversion
capacity-density relationships show that the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion
obtained with suspensions up to approximately 10 grams (dry weight)
per liter is linear with relation to density. This indicates that the supply
of H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> is adequate. Upon a further increase in cell concentration,
the conversion rate still increases but not linearly. The highest
amount of CO<sub>2</sub> taken up per liter of suspension was approximately 2
liters per hour. At these very high cell concentrations, the relationship
between rate of conversion and density is no longer linear. This is
demonstrated when the conversion rate is calculated per unit cell weight
instead of per unit suspension volume. The rate per gram dry weight
per liter decreases from 146 to 68 ml of CO<sub>2</sub> per hour. With a suspension
at a density of approximately 10 grams, the conversion of 1.1 liters of
CO<sub>2</sub> per liter per hour is obtained. At a CO<sub>2</sub> output of 22 liters per man
per hour, 20 liters of suspension would be sufficient to balance the gas
exchange needs of one man.</p>
<p class="pnext">At higher cell concentrations, less volume of suspension would suffice
if gas equilibration could be maintained at the higher consumption rates
to avoid anaerobic conditions which could lead to a shift in metabolism.
In the final analysis, the technical problem of gas transfer from the gas
to the liquid phase determines the optimal cell concentration and, therefore,
the required suspension volume.</p>
<p class="pnext">From data presently available, it can be concluded that, using the slow-growing
<em class="italics">H. facilis</em>, the volume of suspension required to support one man
is about 500 liters. Using <em class="italics">H. eutropha</em>, Schlegel (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-192" id="id219">[ref.192]</a>) calculated a
suspension volume of 66 liters with 1 gram dry weight of bacteria per liter.</p>
<p class="pnext">In recent NASA-supported research, the amount of culture medium
has been estimated using improved cultivation methods and conditions.
For batch culture, the data show that from 10 to 66 liters would be
required per man, with a best practical estimate of 20 liters at 9 to 10
grams dry weight of bacteria per liter (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-191" id="id220">[ref.191]</a>). For continuous culture
using the turbidostat, the present data indicate a demand for some 30
<span class="pageno target" title="88" id="page-88"> </span>liters of suspension, and a volume of 20 liters (at approximately 10 grams
dry weight of bacteria per liter) as a realistic goal.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the foregoing section, the material balance for gases and water was
discussed. It was shown that a close match could be obtained with these
components of the closed environment.</p>
<p class="pnext">Less abundant, though no less important, are the nonwater components
of urine and feces. The urine is important for the content of
fixed nitrogen and other products of man's metabolism and serves as a
very effective substrate for cultivation of hydrogen bacteria. Maximum
closure of the system necessitates utilization of the urea in urine as a
nitrogen source.</p>
<p class="pnext">The average man produces 1.2 to 1.6 liters of urine per 24-hour period.
This contains about 0.00005 gram per liter of iron, 0.113 gram per liter of
magnesium, and 24.5 grams per liter of urea (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-193" id="id221">[ref.193]</a>). As shown in
<a class="reference internal pginternal" href="#table-x">table X</a>, each liter of bacterial medium requires 0.008 gram per liter of
Fe(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, about 0.1 gram of MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O, and 1.0 gram per liter
of urea. In comparing the daily urine output with the estimated
required ingredients of a bacterial medium, a relatively close balance is
observed, with the exception of iron.</p>
<p class="pnext">For the fixation of 24 moles of CO<sub>2</sub> (288 grams of C) produced per man
per day, the production of about 640 grams dry bacterial mass is required.
At an average N-content of 12 percent, the nitrogen requirement would
be some 100 grams. A comparison of daily output (urine) and daily
requirement by the bacterial suspension reveals that only 10 to 33 percent
of this amount could be recovered from average urine. To obtain a
material balance, either the man must be fed a protein-rich diet or the
bacterial suspension must be grown under conditions which lead to the
production of a cell mass relatively low in protein content. Experiments
have indicated that nitrogen starvation of the bacterial culture might be
a promising solution. Culture "staging" (cultivation under nitrogen-rich
conditions, followed by cultivation in the absence of substrate nitrogen
and subsequent harvesting for food processing) will probably be the most
promising means of nitrogen economy in the closed environment. As
discussed in a following section, a biomass of relatively high lipid content
can be obtained under conditions of nitrogen starvation.</p>

<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Continuous Culture of <em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas</em> Bacteria</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Growth of hydrogen bacteria in a batch culture, after an initial period
of adjustment, becomes steady and rapid during the exponential growth
phase. This steady state of growth is temporary and ceases when nutrient
substrate or gas concentrations drop to limiting values. For long periods
a continual supply of nutrients must be provided. Growth then occurs
<span class="pageno target" title="89" id="page-89"> </span>under steady-state conditions for prolonged periods, and such factors as
pH, concentration of nutrient, oxygen, and metabolic products (which
change during batch culture) are all maintained constant in continuous
culture.</p>
<p class="pnext">Two methods can be used for control of continuous cultures: the
turbidostat and the chemostat. In the turbidostat, regulation of medium
input and cell concentration is controlled by optically sensing the
turbidity of the culture.</p>
<p class="pnext">The dilution rate varies with the population density of the culture and
maintains the density within a narrow range. Organisms grow at the
maximum rate characteristic of the organism and the conditions. The
growth rate can be changed by modifying the nutrient medium, gas concentration,
or incubation temperature. A disadvantage of the turbidostat
is that all nutrient concentrations in the culture chamber are necessarily
higher than the minimum, resulting in inefficient utilization of nutrients.</p>
<p class="pnext">The turbidostat system for continuous culture of <em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas</em>
bacteria, developed by Battelle Memorial Institute (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-194" id="id222">[ref.194]</a>), includes
electrolysis of water in a separate unit. Hydrogen and oxygen are fed
separately up to the point of injection into the culture vessel, and the
mixed volume is kept very small to minimize am possibility of explosion.
However, the two gases may be injected simultaneously if there is a
demand for both.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the chemostat, growth of the organisms is limited by maintaining
one essential nutrient concentration below optimum. A constant feed
of medium, with one nutrient in limiting concentration and with constant
removal of culture at the same rate, is used to achieve the steady
state. The dilution rate is set at an arbitrary value, and the microbial
population is allowed to find its own level. By appropriate setting of the
dilution rate, the growth rate may be held at any desired value from
slightly below the maximum possible to nearly zero. This constitutes
a self-regulating system and allows selection of a desired growth rate.</p>
<p class="pnext">A combined electrolysis-chemostat method, developed by Magna Corp.,
maintained the hydrogen-producing electrode of an electrolysis cell in
the bacterial culture. Resting cells of <em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas eutropha</em> consumed
hydrogen produced at the cathode of an electrolysis cell built into
a specially constructed Warburg flask. Attempts to immobilize <em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas</em>
cells on a porous conductor were partially successful. This
system could lower the volume requirements compared with those for the
isolated subsystems. Disadvantages of this integrated system include
electrolysis of the bacterial medium, possibly resulting in toxic breakdown
products, and the possible effects of electric power and the KOH
electrolyte on the bacteria. The main disadvantage of an integrated
<span class="pageno target" title="90" id="page-90"> </span>system would be the disparity between optimal conditions for efficient
electrolysis and efficient bacterial conversion, particularly temperature
and pH, with the combination possibly resulting in considerably higher
power and weight demands.</p>
<p class="pnext">Both continuous-culture approaches are being studied with NASA
support. The turbidostat offers the greatest potential efficiency in weight
and volume, but uses nutrient materials less efficiently and is more complex.
The chemostat is less efficient in weight and volume, but has
greater simplicity and reliability.</p>
<p class="pnext"><em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas eutropha</em> has been grown in 15-liter batch cultures
and in 2.1-liter continuous cultures. A 20-liter continuous culture,
sufficient to balance the requirements of a man, is under development.</p>
<p class="pnext">The potential problem areas in large-scale continuous production of
the bacteria include assuring genetic stability, preventing or controlling
bacteriophage and foreign bacterial contamination, and preventing
heterotrophic growth caused by exposure to organic material from the
urine. Genetics of hydrogen bacteria and phage infection have been
studied by DeCicco. Research on these problems indicates that they are
not of major importance, but cause significant effects and must be eliminated
or controlled.</p>

are the weight penalties most probably involved in the processing of the solid output
of the exchangers, elegantly defined as potential food. Further research is required
in this area to evaluate the regenerative systems, especially the bacteria, with respect to
this potential. Furthermore, as yet there is no experimental proof that the growth
rates of the heavy bacterial suspensions can be realized in a large design, determined
on a relatively small scale with fairly precise control of physiological conditions and

<p class="pfirst">In the first U.S. manned space flight program, Project Mercury, and in
the face of very severe weight limitations, a cabin atmosphere of pure
oxygen at one-third atmospheric pressure was adopted. This choice
probably represented the greatest simplification which could be achieved
readily and, at the same time, provide protection against some of the
risks of rapid decompression. Although breathing pure oxygen at
higher pressures was known to be attended by some undesirable
physiological effects, the short duration of the flights to be undertaken,
and the low pressure employed, suggested that no harmful results would
result in this case. That these expectations were generally borne out is
now history. Preparations for space flights of longer duration—many
weeks or months—present similar problems and require special attention
to phenomena which may be either undetectable or of trivial significance
on a time scale of a few days.</p>
<div class="level-4 section" id="physiological-criteria-in-the-choice-of-cabin-atmosphere">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title"><span class="pageno target" title="93" id="page-93"> </span>Physiological Criteria in the Choice of Cabin Atmosphere</h4>
<p class="pfirst">If maintenance of normal respiratory function were the only consideration,
a cabin atmosphere of about sea-level composition and pressure
might be an ideal and straightforward choice for manned spacecraft. In
fact, this atmosphere has been used in the manned space flights conducted
by the U.S.S.R. No other atmosphere has been shown to be more satisfactory
from the physiological point of view, and the tedious respiratory
studies which should accompany the use of other atmospheres can be
avoided. Nevertheless, the formidable problems of spacecraft design
and the necessary precautions for safeguarding the crew from accident
require that other atmospheric compositions and pressures be considered.
For example, if a cabin at 1-atm pressure were decompressed to space
suit pressure (0.3 atm), the occupants would develop decompression
sickness; i.e., "bends."</p>
<p class="pnext">Several engineering considerations argue for low cabin pressures and
pure oxygen composition. Among these are structural design, weight of
atmospheric gas storage and control equipment, and the difficulty of contriving
pressure suits which allow operation at pressures near one atmosphere.
Such departures from the normal human gaseous environment,
however, require the demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and
physiological performance.</p>
<p class="pnext">The limits of the composition and pressure of acceptable cabin atmospheres
are then set by—</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">A pure oxygen atmosphere at a pressure which will provide an
alveolar oxygen partial pressure equal to that provided by air
at sea level</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first pfirst">A mixed gas (oxygen and inert gas) atmosphere having a pressure
and composition that will allow decompression to the highest
acceptable suit pressure without the risk of bends</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">A numerical value for the lower limit (1) is approximately 0.2 atm of
pure oxygen. The upper limit (2) is determined by the operating
pressure and composition of the space-suit atmosphere and may be of the
order of 0.5 atm for a cabin atmosphere of 50 percent oxygen. It is
necessary to determine the astronaut's ability to survive and perform his
duties in any atmosphere selected.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Localized or diffuse collapse of alveoli in the lungs may, if the condition
persists, lead to arterial hypoxia which may be extremely undesirable
under the stresses of space flight. The alveoli are probably unstable
when pure oxygen is breathed; they tend to collapse if there is blockage
of the airways, especially at low pressures. This collapse occurs because
<span class="pageno target" title="94" id="page-94"> </span>each of the gases present in the alveoli (oxygen, water vapor, and carbon
dioxide) is subject to prompt and complete absorption from the alveoli
by the blood.</p>
<p class="pnext">The alveoli are normally stabilized against collapse by the presence of
inert and relatively insoluble gas (nitrogen) and an internal coating of
lipoprotein substances with low surface tension.</p>
<p class="pnext">Theoretical and experimental results strongly suggest the desirability
of using oxygen-inert gas atmospheres for long missions to avoid
atelectasis and other gas absorption phenomena, such as retraction of the
eardrum. However, further experimental evidence is required both to
confirm this point and to establish its upper limit of suitability of pure
oxygen atmospheres.</p>

<p class="pfirst">It has long been known that breathing pure oxygen at normal atmospheric

<p class="pnext">The effect of 100 percent oxygen at a simulated altitude of
26 000 feet for 6 weeks was studied using white rats at Oklahoma City
University under a NASA grant. Radioactive carbon techniques
revealed a 15-percent reduction of metabolism in the 100-percent oxygen-exposed

20-percent decrease in lipid metabolism in the liver compared with
controls, but no decrease in heart metabolism. There was no gross
change in body weight.</p>
<p class="pnext">The White Leghorn chick between 2 and 7 weeks old is markedly
resistant to the toxic effects of 1 atm of O<sub>2</sub>. Continuous exposure (Ohio
State University) for as long as 4 weeks did not cause deaths, obvious
morbidity, or any signs of pulmonary damage on gross autopsy. Nevertheless,
the hyperoxia had some adverse effects, primarily reducing the
growth rate to between three-fourths to one-fourth of normal; reducing
feed intake per unit body weight to three-fourths of normal; slowing
respiratory rate by 30 percent; decreasing erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and
hematocrit by 9 to 12 percent; and causing reversible histological changes
in the lungs. Arterial O<sub>2</sub> tensions were elevated over 300-mm Hg, but
arterial pCO<sub>2</sub> and blood pH were unaffected. No residual effects were

<p class="pnext">Studies at Ohio State University in 1964, under a NASA grant, showed
that helium substituted for nitrogen in a closed container causes humans

animals have shown that in a helium atmosphere there is greater heat
loss due to the increased conducting capacity and probably greater
evaporative capacity. In 6 days at 21 percent oxygen and 79 percent
helium at 1-atmosphere pressure, young rats grew at the same rate as
controls, but drank more water, excreted more urine, and had a higher
rate of food and oxygen consumption than controls in air at 1 atmosphere.

this phenomenon has nothing to do with respiratory physiology, the

measures. Unless effective countermeasures can be devised, this risk may
argue very strongly against the use of such atmospheres in the future.

another part of the lungs. Blood flow diminishes in some parts of
the lungs and increases in others. Fluid leaks from the blood into the
tissues and into the air sacs in parts of the lungs. These effects cause
difficulty in breathing, low arterial oxygen saturation, and impaired
consciousness during high sustained acceleration and, to a lesser extent,
after its cessation. They must be considered when selecting the best gas
to be breathed, since a high partial pressure of oxygen is favorable for
consciousness, but a low inert-gas concentration during acceleration is
unfavorable for rapid lung recovery afterward.</p>

<div class="level-3 section" id="physiological-problems">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">PHYSIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS</h3>
<p class="pfirst">A study of the manned space flights and laboratory observations to date
suggests that during long periods of weightlessness, some physiological
difficulties may arise which may produce serious effects on human performance.
Although recent experience gives no grounds for expecting
insuperable difficulties, neither the quantity nor quality of the available
observations permits the conclusion that long-term exposure to weightlessness
will <em class="italics">not</em> have serious consequences. The critical role to be played
by the astronaut demands that every effort be made to identify in advance
<span class="pageno target" title="97" id="page-97"> </span>those phenomena which may affect performance, and to study their
qualitative and quantitative relationships so that proper precautions
can be taken.</p>
<p class="pnext">Lawton (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-197" id="id233">[ref.197]</a>), in reviewing the literature on prolonged weightlessness,
found few instances in which physiological function was truly
gravity dependent. He stated that the physiological systems likely to be
most affected by weightlessness were the musculoskeletal system, the
cardiovascular system, and the equilibrium senses. Subsequent experience
proved this to be the case. McCally and Lawton (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-198" id="id234">[ref.198]</a>) analyzed
the data from experiments since 1961 and concluded that much more
basic laboratory work is necessary. Studies using immobilization, immersion,
and cabin-confinement techniques were recommended approaches
toward simulating weightlessness.</p>
<p class="pnext">Much of the difficulty in obtaining precise information of anticipated
problems arises from a lack of knowledge of normal mammalian
physiology. Many of these deficiencies can be remedied in the laboratory.
In space-flight development, however, two distinct investigational
approaches can be adopted. The first of these may be characterized as
empirical and incremental; that is, the capabilities of the astronaut are
explored in successive flights involving relatively modest increases in
difficulty or severity of the environmental conditions. In this way it is
hoped to ascertain the human limitations without running too great a
risk. The second approach can be described as fundamental: determining
by a series of controlled experiments the effects of exposure to
space-flight conditions upon comparative mammalian physiology, with
emphasis on man. A fundamental understanding of the observed effects
would be sought so that predictions for new situations and possible ways
to control them could be made with confidence.</p>

<p class="pfirst">NASA has emphasized that planning for manned space programs
involves a systematic extension from physiological observations in animals
to man, and finally the establishment of man as part of the man-vehicle
system design. Moreover, these studies require the evaluation of
central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other
<span class="pageno target" title="98" id="page-98"> </span>systems as a matrix in mutual interdependence. There is particular
interest in the effects of weightlessness on flights exceeding 30 days.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mammalian flights of about 30 days also merit attention, including
the development of the life-support systems which must precede such a
program. Development of facilities for biological experiments may well
be an important requirement for studies in anticipation of manned flights
of longer duration than Apollo. Unless the biological satellite programs
of the type mentioned above are successful in providing the necessary
data, a manned orbiting laboratory may also be important in studies of
shorter range.</p>
<div class="level-4 section" id="general-studies-of-biological-rhythmicity">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">General Studies of Biological Rhythmicity</h4>
<p class="pfirst">The effects of weightlessness on the organism as a whole may be manifested
by important changes in certain integrated behavioral patterns
having an inherently rhythmic character. Modifications in basic
behavioral patterns and performance may occur as disruptions of
rhythmic physiological phenomena, which are themselves the end product
of interrelated functional activity in a number of physiological
systems, such as the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and central nervous
systems.</p>
<p class="pnext">Measurements of interdependent components of biological rhythmicity
are beginning to be analyzed by methods well established in physics—including
correlation and spectral analyses, and phase modulation and
variance in rhythmic processes. A wide variety of physiological functions
can be treated as periodic variables in the analysis, including rhythmicities
in cardiac output and blood pressure, respiration, brain waves, and
the slower tides of appetite, and sleep-wakefulness. The importance of
such investigations argues for their inclusion in forthcoming flight programs.
Their experimental simplicity is an additional advantage.
Biorhythms have been discussed in more detail in the section on

<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Effects of Weightlessness on the Cardiovascular System</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Earlobe oximetry, indirect measurements of blood flow and of blood
pressure by finger plethysmography or impedance plethysmography, and
ballistocardiographic techniques have potential application to manned
space flight.</p>
<p class="pnext">Adaptation to prolonged exposure to weightlessness or to lunar gravity
may cause difficulties when the astronaut is exposed again to reentry
forces and terrestrial gravity. It is possible that these adaptive changes
may thus produce unacceptable effects on performance or cause risk to
life. It is important to obtain experimental evidence on this subject.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="99" id="page-99"> </span>It is common knowledge that following a stay in bed, dizziness, <span class="target" id="faintness">faintness</span>,
and weakness characterize arising, and that a feeling of general
weakness may persist for several days. The phenomenon has been investigated
in a number of laboratories. One approach has been to put
healthy young subjects to bed, and even in extensive casts for periods of
2 or 3 weeks or more. Two major findings have emerged from these
studies. First, a substantial adjustment in the blood circulatory system
occurs, which is termed the "hypodynamic state." Second, there is a
large decrease in the skeletal and muscle mass of the body.</p>
<p class="pnext">There are two kinds of evidence for the hypodynamic state: measurement
of parameters of circulatory function, and measurement of the
response of the individuals to a quantitatively imposed mild gravitational
load. After 3 weeks in bed, otherwise healthy persons exhibit an increase
of more than 20 percent in heart rate; a reduction of 10 to 20 percent in
total blood volume, primarily as a result of reduction of plasma volume;
and a decrease in heart size of about 8 percent. Coupled with these
cardiovascular changes is a reduction of 10 percent in the basal metabolic
rate. It appears as though the circulation and metabolism are reset to a
lower functional level commensurate with the reduced demands placed
on the whole organism.</p>
<p class="pnext">After 3 weeks of bed rest, all of the subjects tested showed pronounced
orthostatic hypotension. After tilting, the average heart rate increased
by 37 beats per minute, the systolic blood pressure fell some 12-mm Hg,
and some of the subjects fainted. The measurements were continued
for 16 days after the bed-rest period, and it was round that recovery was
not quite complete when the experiment was terminated.</p>
<p class="pnext">There is little question that in prolonged exposures to the weightless
state, there is a fair probability of extensive circulatory adjustments, the
seriousness of which cannot yet be foretold. While it is likely that the
astronauts will adapt successfully to long periods of weightlessness at
some new circulatory functional level, the remote possibility exists that
the circulatory changes may be progressive to the point of ultimate
failure.</p>

<div class="level-3 section" id="metabolic-effects-of-weightlessness">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">Metabolic Effects of Weightlessness</h3>
<p class="pfirst">Without metabolic information, accurate planning of environmental
systems for long flights is difficult. Importance is also attached to early
evaluation of weightlessness effects on body-fluid equilibria. The results
of Earth orbital flights and of terrestrial water-immersion experiments
suggest the occurrence of undesirable changes, although no effects leading
to operational incapacity have yet arisen.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="100" id="page-100"> </span>In both recumbency and immersion, a similar redistribution of body
fluids occurs. It has been suggested that recumbency may affect an
extracellular fluid-volume receptor mechanism which by decreasing
aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland, would decrease sodium reabsorption
by the renal tubules. Aldosterone excretion decreases during
recumbency and during standing in water, but increases while standing
in air. There is also evidence for cardiac atrial volume receptor mechanisms
which respond to increased filling of the left atrium with reflex
inhibition of release of pituitary antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting
in diuresis (Henry-Gauer reflex).</p>
<p class="pnext">Altered fluid equilibrium in buoyant states is accompanied by shifts in
intracellular and extracellular electrolyte distribution, especially sodium
and potassium. Evidence from recumbency studies indicates a strong
correlation between loss of erect posture or weight bearing and excretion
of calcium stores in bone.</p>
<p class="pnext">A bone X-ray densitometry method has been developed by Mack, at
Texas Woman's University, for accurately determining the loss of bone
mineral (±2 percent accuracy) in humans and animals. The heel bone
and spine are X-rayed using a calibrated aluminum wedge as a standard.
This technique will be used for preflight and postflight analysis of the
primate being flown in the 30-day biosatellite. Comparative appraisal
of bone mineral behavior in astronauts participating in the Gemini and
Apollo programs will be invaluable for future flight missions.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bed rest and immobilization studies by Mack have shown loss of
skeletal mineral and increased calcium in the urine and excreta. Four
bed-rest studies, each extending for 2 weeks, compared different levels of
calcium intake. Four men were used in each study and served as their
own controls during extended ambulatory periods. During 2-week
periods, up to 10 percent of calcium mineral was lost from the heel bone.
Calcium was also determined in the urine and feces. In other studies,
isometric exercises reduced loss of bone mineral during bed rest.</p>
<p class="pnext">Excretion of calcium in the urine is accompanied by risk of its deposition
as calculi or "kidney stones" in the urinary tract. Currently,
changes in calcium metabolism resulting from weightlessness over periods
up to 2 weeks is not considered a hazard requiring precautionary
measures.</p>
<p class="pnext">Flights in excess of 2 weeks, however, constitute a problem serious
enough to warrant study on the 11-day orbital flights and the 30-day
biosatellite primate mission. Therapeutic immobilization, post-poliomyelitis
immobility, and experimental restraint in normal subjects lead
to a negative calcium balance, with hypercalciuria.</p>

<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title"><span class="pageno target" title="101" id="page-101"> </span>Central Nervous System Functions in Weightlessness</h4>
<p class="pfirst">The wide range of individual tolerances to the disturbing effects of
vestibular stimulation has emphasized the importance of this factor in
astronaut selection. At the same time, vestibular functions must be considered
jointly with visual task performance, since both have special
significance for such maneuvers as vehicle docking. Vestibular function
in the weightless state remains almost completely unknown. Limited
evidence from animal and manned space flights suggests that head turning,
resulting from vestibular stimulation, may seriously interfere with
visuomotor performance, but that susceptibility to these disturbances is
significantly different between individuals and that partial adaptation
occurs relatively quickly.</p>
<p class="pnext">NASA is currently collecting extensive baseline electroencephalogram
data under controlled conditions in a form suitable for mathematical
analysis. Data are being taken from about 200 subjects in major national
and overseas centers. It is intended that this study will assist in astronaut
selection and monitoring in space.</p>
<p class="pnext">Studies on many effects of weightlessness on nervous functions require
monitoring of the autonomic nervous system, including such autonomic
effects as gastrointestinal activity, secretion, lacrimation, salivation, sweating,
and the central control of respiration. Urinary estimations of
catecholamines and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid would provide important
data on autonomic system activity if collected in flight and compared
with preflight and postflight controls.</p>
<p class="pnext">Major areas have been outlined in which prolonged weightlessness
may be expected to interfere with performance, judgment, and, ultimately,
chances of survival. These include cardiovascular, metabolic,
central nervous, psychophysiological, and biorhythmic effects. They
have been dealt with separately and in sequence, but have not been
intended to be viewed as hierarchic. The relative scarcity of data
necessarily precludes such an evaluation.</p>
<p class="pnext">Soviet experience with zero gravity and weightlessness has increased
their emphasis on this space-flight factor and was an important topic at
the May 1964 COSPAR meeting. Discussion of the postflight medical
status of Bykovsky (5-day flight) and Tereshkova (3-day flight) revealed
a concern for the significance of prolonged weightlessness and the
presence of postflight physical debility and fatigue following Vostok
flights 3 through 6. These changes persisted for several days. Among
the physiological conditions singled out for mention were—</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst"><em class="italics">Body fluids</em>— Cosmonauts have shown a postflight weight loss of 1.9

is complete within the first 24 hours of flight. Titov is

consumption during the standard postflight exercise test.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">In both of these areas there was a return to normal within the postflight
period of study. The Soviets have continued their biological experiments
in space with the Vostok/Voshkod series. Fixing of histologic
specimens in flight by Bykovsky demonstrated a critical role for man and
made possible an expanded experimental program. Biopackages have
become more complex with each succeeding flight.</p>
<p class="pnext">With the exception of postflight orthostatic intolerance after the third
and fourth Mercury flights, changes as a result of exposure to a zero-gravity
environment have not been noted by U.S. investigations in space.
Ground-based research proceeds here at an advanced pace and is supported
in large measure by both the USAF and NASA. A study of the
relationships among renal and systemic hemodynamics, neurohumoral
cardiovascular regulation, and renal excretory function in differently
positioned subjects is underway, as are studies of acceleration tolerance.</p>

<div class="level-3 section" id="depressed-metabolism">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">DEPRESSED METABOLISM</h3>
<p class="pfirst">In anticipation of prolonged manned space flights, NASA has sponsored
research related to metabolism depression. The daily food requirements,
for example, of astronauts during a voyage of several months can
constitute a major portion of the weight and storage capacity of the
spacecraft. A somewhat promising and fundamental approach to this
problem is the reduction of the astronauts' daily metabolic requirements.
It has been suggested that astronauts on prolonged space missions be put
in a state of suspended animation until their destination is reached.
Though this sounds fantastic, 10 years ago no cell had been frozen to
cryogenic temperatures and survived. Today it is commonplace for
tissues to be frozen, stored at low temperatures, and thawed and then to
maintain their viability and function.</p>
<p class="pnext">Animal metabolism may be depressed by reducing body temperature,
as in hibernation and hypothermia. Other means by which metabolism
can be lowered include drugs and electronarcosis. Hibernation is a
<span class="pageno target" title="103" id="page-103"> </span>nonstressful state and results in a great decrease in metabolism. However,
human beings are not hibernators, and much research is needed
before the mechanism of hibernation is understood, and the possibility of
inducing it in humans evaluated. Hypothermia is the direct cooling of
the body to temperatures where metabolism is substantially depressed.
Extracorporeal circulation systems combined with cooling are in routine
use in most medical centers throughout the world. Hypothermia is not
an ideal solution, however, since general body hypothermia is a stressful
condition. Pharmacologic induction of hypothermia can be accomplished
by such drugs as chlorpromazine and harbamil. Other drugs
can be used to depress metabolism, but all have some disadvantage.</p>
<p class="pnext">In recent years there has been a growing interest in electronarcosis, the
induction of sleep by an electric current. Although potentially valuable,
this method is far from routine application.</p>
<p class="pnext">Outstanding advances have been made in metabolism suppression.
Recent progress in the biochemistry and physiology of hibernation and
hypothermia have shown that the oxygen requirements of individual
mammals, organs, and tissues can be reduced. When the chemical composition
of the blood and the cardiac output are sufficient to meet
cellular requirements, regulatory mechanisms remain effective and
animal survival is assured. In contrast, when oxygen transport is interrupted,
a reduction in cellular activity occurs and regulation is impaired.
In induced hypothermia, the low temperature slows the rates of all
processes and modifies the action of metabolites and other substances.
This in itself is not harmful, as shown by the true hibernating animal
(e.g., ground squirrel), but will become disastrous as soon as anoxia and
chemical imbalance begin to develop.</p>
<p class="pnext">The phenomenon of natural hibernation is being investigated in the
laboratory in the hope that the unusual tolerance of hibernating animals
to reduced metabolism and low body temperature may some day be
produced artificially in ordinary laboratory animals and man. Experiments
with the ground squirrel, a typical hibernator, show that the
artificially cooled ground squirrel does not tolerate such long periods of
low body temperature as does a naturally hibernating animal.</p>
<p class="pnext">Other studies of the brown adipose tissue (fat), which is present in most
hibernating mammals, show it to be essential to hibernation. Indications
that brown fat has a thermogenic role in rats exposed to low temperatures
suggest that this may be the case in true hibernators (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-199" id="id235">[ref.199]</a>).
Arousal of the hibernating animal by cold is triggered by sympathetically
activated thermogenesis in areas of brown fat so located, relative to the
vasculature, that the heat is transferred to areas of the body concerned
with normal metabolic and nervous activity.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="104" id="page-104"> </span>Soviet work comparing various depressed metabolic states and resistances
to acceleration shows deep winter <span class="target" id="hibernation">hibernation</span> to be most effective,
followed by deep hypothermia, and drug narcosis as the least effective.</p>
<p class="pnext">Experimental evidence is being accumulated to show that hibernation
and hypothermia somewhat protect animals against radiation. Clinical
studies on irradiation of cancer patients indicate that lowering the body
temperature reduces cellular metabolism and thus decreases tissue
sensitivity to gamma radiation (<a class="citation-reference pginternal" href="#ref-200" id="id236">[ref.200]</a>).</p>
<p class="pnext">The use of prolonged hypothermia, hibernation, drugs, and electronarcosis
appears to hold some potential for reducing astronauts' metabolic
requirements. If one or mote of these methods become practical, human
requirements for food and oxygen could be drastically reduced. Simultaneously,
these methods may afford radiation protection and acceleration
tolerance.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The human body can use food stores so that the nutritional requirements
can be reduced for a short time. This will vary widely among
individuals and each individual may exhibit characteristic patterns of
nutritional behavior. During reduced food intake, muscular efficiency
may not change significantly over a period of 4 to 6 days; unfortunately,
however, mental activity begins to decline after 24 hours. Feeding
requirements can be divided into two categories: short term (for missions
of less than 21 days) and long term. Since dehydration can occur in a
matter of hours under adverse conditions, water requirements must be
considered as a special case.</p>
<div class="level-4 section" id="water-requirements">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Water Requirements</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Water requirements are extremely critical and the amount supplied

large margin of safety should be allowed.</p>
<p class="pnext">Present data on water requirements show a very strong dependence
upon suit inlet temperatures. In the absence of an accurately controlled
suit temperature, water requirements can easily double. If this should
occur, the mission would probably have to be aborted, since it is doubtful
if electrolyte balance would be maintained at such high rates of water
loss. Normal or even extreme conditions of the terrestrial environment
usually include diurnal variation in temperature which may modify
water needs. These conditions will not be obtained in the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="105" id="page-105"> </span>In addition to ground-based experiments, measurements of water intake

<div class="level-3 section" id="formula-diets">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">Formula Diets</h3>
<p class="pfirst">The tacit assumption which now prevails, "Astronauts even on short-term
missions require a diet of great variety," is apparently not well
supported. In many parts of the world, people live on a monotonous
diet consisting of only a few types of food with no apparent ill effects,
provided their nutritional requirements are satisfied. Experimental evidence
from many sources (e.g., the Army Medical Research and Nutrition
Laboratory) shows that individuals can be kept on a single disagreeable
formula diet for as long as 60 to 90 days without harm. Since highly
motivated individuals are chosen for space flights, it is unlikely that they
would object to the monotony of a formula diet and would probably
prefer its simplicity. Also, there are definite possibilities of developing
a much more acceptable formula than present types. There is no reason
to anticipate adverse effects from the use of formula diets in short-term
flights.</p>
<p class="pnext">Formula diets would be extremely desirable for short-term flights. A
formula diet (a rehydrated liquid formula could be used) would considerably
reduce the number of manipulations and the time required for
in-flight preparation, compared to a varied diet. These two improvements
could contribute materially to the safety of a flight, since the astronauts
would not be preoccupied with food preparation for so long a
period, and the food could be dispensed without removing suit components,
such as gloves. Storage requirements could be simplified with
this type of diet. Weight, however, would not be lowered without the
development of more refined formulas than those now available.
Formula diets could readily be adapted to the determined metabolic
requirements of the individual astronaut. Packaging problems will be
simplified by using formula diets, which can easily be given a variety of
flavors and colors.</p>
<div class="level-4 section" id="waste">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Waste</h4>
<p class="pfirst">The problem of waste production is intimately related to nutrition
and can be solved or simplified by dietary changes. Any diet should be
adjusted for the minimum production of feces, before and during even
short flights. Water will be sequestered by accumulation in the feces,
and the net loss, under normal conditions, would be approximately 40 to
60 grams per man per day. Flatus can be a serious problem, since
<span class="pageno target" title="106" id="page-106"> </span>considerable concentrations of toxic gases may accumulate. The purification
system for the recirculated atmosphere must be able to remove these,
although the diet should be planned to minimize the problem. The
collection of urine and its storage is of importance, particularly on short-term
flights, and individual packaging and labeling of urine specimens
will be necessary for the analyses.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="metabolism">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Metabolism</h4>
<p class="pfirst">An accurately measured intake of nutrients, calories, and water is

flight. There is insufficient knowledge to predict total metabolic requirements
under the numerous stresses which can be anticipated. Simulator
studies are of great importance even for short-duration flights.</p>
<p class="pnext">The two most important variables to be considered in establishing the
minimal diet are protein and energy requirements. NASA is supporting
research at the University of California (Berkeley) to determine these
requirements and to estimate individual variation in healthy young men.
The possibility of minimizing need through biological adaptation is
being explored.</p>
<p class="pnext">It is difficult to estimate the minimum protein requirement of an adult
man. The generally accepted criterion of minimum adequate protein
nutrition in the adult is the maintenance of nitrogen balance at minimum
intake. The minimum protein requirements depend on endogenous
nitrogen loss. Analysis of the little data available indicates a best estimate
of 2 mg of nitrogen per kilocalorie of basal energy expenditure.
However, this figure is higher than that noted in experiments in some
human subjects.</p>
<p class="pnext">After minimum nitrogen requirements and minimum amino acid
requirements have been established, studies will be directed toward
investigating caloric restriction and adaptation to restriction of calories.
It has been suggested that caloric restriction in animals and man results
in apparent decreased energy need for the same activity. This apparent
paradox has never been explained. It has been shown that there is
adaptation to repeated episodes of caloric restriction both in animals
and man, so that subsequent periods of caloric restriction result in
decreased rate of weight loss, nitrogen loss, and longer survival.</p>
<p class="pnext">Additional experiments are urgently required to determine the
metabolic demands for minerals—in particular, the metabolic balance
of calcium, potassium, sodium, and phosphorus. Under conditions of
high water consumption, large mineral losses are to be expected. Failure
to replace these can cause an imbalance which could impair the efficiency
of the individual to the extent of endangering the flight.</p>
<p class="pnext"><span class="pageno target" title="107" id="page-107"> </span>Analysis of samples taken in flight, both of urine and feces, should be
made. Respiratory quotients can be determined in flight, blood samples
should be taken before and immediately after flight for analyzing selected
components (in simulator studies these could be taken periodically), and
nutritional intakes (which would be facilitated by formula diets) must be
measured and analyzed.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="short-range-technology">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Short-Range Technology</h4>
<p class="pfirst">There are many practical difficulties in providing for food storage and
accessibility in spacecraft. The packaging of food materials, both
dehydrated and liquid, has proceeded satisfactorily under the supervision
of the Food and Container Institute. If packaging materials are to be
made to withstand very high relative humidities and large variations in
temperature, additional investigations are required, since such containers
are not yet available. In packaging, serious consideration must be given
to the ease with which the food may be reached and eaten.</p>
<p class="pnext">If dehydrated formula foods are to be fed on short-term missions, additional
work is required on the rehydration of such formulas. Present
methods of water measurement under weightless conditions are not satisfactory,
and better methods will have to be contrived.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="long-term-nutritional-problems">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Long-Term Nutritional Problems</h4>
<p class="pfirst">There is a dearth of metabolic information, even for short-duration
flights, without which changes in metabolic patterns to longer flights
cannot be extrapolated. However, using scattered information, certain
changes which may be encountered can be hypothesized. Decalcification
of bone and changes in water-holding capacity of the body may be anticipated.
It is also possible that changes in proportion of fat to lean body
mass could be experienced and should be considered in nutritional
planning. Nutritional requirements depend on size, particularly lean
body mass, sex, physiological state, and individual metabolic rates.
Therefore, individuals for space flight should be screened with these
factors in mind if it is desirable to minimize food intake in long flights.
The factors which influence the total nutritional requirements of the
individual also influence his mental and physical responses to stress.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="synthetic-foods">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Synthetic Foods</h4>
<p class="pfirst">The development of food materials other than those derived directly
from animal or vegetable origin is of interest. Advantages of such diets
may be low residue, ease of storage, rehydration, and manipulation.
Experiments with chemically defined synthetic diet for humans have
been carried out by Medical Sciences Research Foundation, San Mateo,
<span class="pageno target" title="108" id="page-108"> </span>Calif. The complete liquid diet is composed of required amino acids,
fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals. A cubic foot of the diet (50
percent solids in H<sub>2</sub>O) supplies 2500 calories per day for 1 month, and
has been given a variety of artificial flavors.</p>
<p class="pnext">This synthetic diet has been fed to human volunteers for 6 months in a
pilot study at the California Medical Facility, Vacaville, Calif., and the
results are being reviewed. Schwarz Bioresearch, Inc., is studying the
storage, stability, and packaging of chemically defined synthetic diets for
human and animal flights.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="food-production-in-space">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Food Production in Space</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Long-term feeding in space depends upon a payload of stored food
unless food is produced during flight. If sufficient propulsive energy is
available, the duration of missions using stored food may be quite long.
However, in emergencies in which a mission lasts longer than planned,
survival may depend on the ability to produce food extraterrestrially.
Eventually it will be desirable or necessary to produce food beyond the
confines of Earth.</p>
<p class="pnext">The nutritional requirements of the crew will be influenced by such
factors as activity, physical and psychological stress, individual size of
the members, and individual metabolic rates. The food intake will have
to be adjusted to meet these requirements. It is necessary to know the
nutritional requirements of each astronaut and the way in which these
are altered by the conditions of space flight in order to estimate needs on
long missions. Without this information, the food supplies for the
longer flights may be too much, too little, or improperly balanced.
Where dependence would not be on stored food alone, but on food
produced en route, more exact information on requirements is needed
to determine the capacity of food production units.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the discussion of bioregenerative systems, it was suggested that food
materials could be produced by photosynthetic organisms (e.g., algae,
duckweed, and other higher plants) or by nonphotosynthetic organisms
(e.g., <em class="italics">Hydrogenomonas</em>). In contrast to the use of living organisms,
reprocessing waste materials by chemical treatment or the actual synthesis
of high-energy compounds has been suggested. No chemical system has
yet been demonstrated as workable for the economical production of food
in space, and the systems considered produce materials which may be
converted to food, but are not food as such.</p>
<p class="pnext">Algal cultures have had the most extensive investigation as food in
space, but the technical problems of using this material as a food source
have not yet been solved. It is apparent from the investigations to date
that algae will require treatment before they can be used as food. In
<span class="pageno target" title="109" id="page-109"> </span>limited trials, difficulties have been experienced with amino acid
deficiencies, digestibility, high residues, and gastric distress. Processing
methods which would be applicable in space travel and the possibility of
secondary conversion by other animals or plants should be systematically
investigated.

<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">SIGNIFICANCE TO SCIENCE</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">O</span><span class="dropspan small-caps">ne of the most critical research areas</span> of the space program is
bioscience. Of both practical and philosophical significance in
exploring the origins of life and the possibilities of life on other planets,
bioscience also promises much in medical aspects. Space offers biologists
completely new environmental factors, such as the effects of zero gravity
and of removal from Earth's rotation. These effects have been studied
in attempts to advance understanding of basic mechanisms of physiology
and biological rhythms. These studies can be of great value in dealing
with problems of disease and metabolic disorders.</p>
<p class="pnext">Biological research is fundamental to the problem of successfully protecting
and sustaining man in the peculiar and hostile space environment.
Understanding human requirements and variations in their response to
various environmental factors offers value in medical research for human
survival and comfort. The many technological discoveries and advancements
in electronic and engineering equipment greatly enhance medical
diagnosis, treatment of disease, and the extension of human life.</p>
<p class="pnext">The life sciences, biology and medicine, are fundamental to the success
of manned exploration of space, which marks a unique and significant
development in the long history of man's conquest of new frontiers.
Those who pioneered other frontiers on land and sea and in the air were
not forced to await biological and medical research. Even the pioneers
of aerial flight began their efforts without first seeking biomedical data.
The search for such data followed flight experience and, indeed, was
made only after problems arose.</p>
<p class="pnext">Project Mercury, NASA's first program for manned space flight, stimulated
immediate and extensive studies in the life sciences to sustain man
in space. Before a vehicle could be designed to carry an astronaut into
space, anticipated biomedical problems associated with space flight were
<span class="pageno target" title="112" id="page-112"> </span>studied. Life-support systems were designed to offer adequate protection
from environmental stresses peculiar to space, such as zero gravity,
removal from Earth's rotation, and high-energy cosmic radiation. These
life-support systems used knowledge already gained from research for
manned space flight by the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p class="pnext">Our entry into space has put us at the threshold of fundamental and
far-reaching discoveries in the biological realm which have profound
implications for other areas of human thought and endeavor. As man
goes farther into space, the hazards increase; but past accomplishments
indicate that the road ahead holds more promise than peril and that the
vistas of knowledge that may be foreseen are as vast as space itself.</p>
<p class="pnext">Almost everything which now can be said about the effects of extraterrestrial
environments and about life on the Moon or the planets lies in
the realm of pure speculation. There is one prediction, however, that
can be made with considerable certainty by reason of historical precedent—the
opportunity to investigate a totally new area, such as is offered by
space exploration, is certain to produce a burst of scientific interest as
soon as the path is charted by a few pioneers. Over the next few decades
a progressively larger proportion of biological interest will turn to space.
We may well expect that the discoveries made here will revolutionize
some of our concepts of biology.</p>
<p class="pnext">It should be fully realized that the accumulation and dissemination of
biological and other scientific information is not only of great value to
science and humanity but is of tremendous import to the prestige of the
Nation.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-3 section" id="significance-for-practical-applications">
<h3 class="center level-3 pfirst section-title title">SIGNIFICANCE FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS</h3>
<p class="pfirst">It can be predicted as confidently for space biology as for other space
sciences that the economic costs will be amply repaid in the long run by
applications of space-oriented biotechnology to other fields of biology
and medicine. There are inevitable substantial, though indirect, contributions
of NASA's continuing efforts in space biology.</p>
<p class="pnext">NASA-supported biological research has many practical applications
and "spinoffs" which contribute to the fields of health and medicine,
food and agriculture, and industry and manufacturing. Some of these
are presented to show the range and value of applications which have
resulted from basic and applied biological research. In addition to those
listed are many others from the biosatellite program, particularly in the
fields of bioengineering and miniaturization.</p>
<div class="level-4 section" id="health-and-medicine">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Health and Medicine</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Solar cells, which have powered space systems, are now being used as
a power source in studies on brain function. A miniaturized solar cell
<span class="pageno target" title="113" id="page-113"> </span>developed by General Electric provides enough power, under ordinary
house lights, to stimulate an animal's brain and to telemeter respiratory,
cardiovascular, and brain-wave data while the animal is allowed to move
about freely. Such a system is now used by the National Institute of
Mental Health Laboratory at Rethesda, Md.</p>
<p class="pnext">Scientists at the Ames Research Center have devised a new technique
for studying organic compounds, whether synthesized in the laboratory
or produced by a living system. This technique is based on a property
of matter called optical activity. Previous methods of measuring optical
activity have been plagued by low sensitivity. The new method is many
tunes more sensitive and represents a real contribution to modern
analytical instrumentation.</p>
<p class="pnext">Studies on calcium metabolism and bed rest simulating weightlessness
are adding knowledge on the prevention of demineralization of the
skeleton; treatment of Paget's disease and osteoporosis prevention of
muscular atrophy; the cause and treatment of renal calculi (kidney
stones); optimal calcium for the human diet; and the factors influencing
calcium absorption, metabolism, and excretion. The results will have
great importance in bone healing and repair, care and treatment of
fracture cases, treatment of paraplegics, and treatment of polio patients
and similar cases. These grant studies at Texas Woman's University
have also proven that the X-ray bone densitometry method can accurately
detect changes in the skeleton.</p>
<p class="pnext">A primary objective of the planetary exploration program is the detection
of possible extraterrestrial life. The study of the fundamental properties
of living things on Earth is restricted to the type of life which has
evolved and survived here. Life which has been exposed to totally
different environmental conditions may have markedly different physiological
characteristics. The impact of the new information obtainable
from the study of extraterrestrial life upon the sciences of medicine and
biology will unquestionably be of fundamental and far-reaching
importance. Advancement in the treatment of disease and the problems
of aging are among the many possible consequences.</p>
<p class="pnext">New developments in such techniques as ultraviolet spectrophotometry,
polarimetry, and gas chromatography will find use in the detection
of biochemicals and other compounds in hospitals and in toxicology and
pathology laboratories. They will also be useful in studies of atmospheric
pollutants such as smog.</p>
<p class="pnext">Studies of the chemistry of living systems, molecular biology, and
biophysics of cellular processes will create a better understanding of the
basic mechanisms of life, leading to an understanding of both inherited
<span class="pageno target" title="114" id="page-114"> </span>and acquired disease, especially neoplastic conditions and chemical
disturbances incident to mental disease.</p>
<p class="pnext">The University of Pittsburgh is conducting a study to increase the
availability of cytological technique in research and as a monitoring procedure
by developing an automatic electronic scanning device using computer
analysis for recording, counting, and sorting chromosomes. Structural
changes in blood cell chromosomes can indicate the degree of
radiation damage as well as damage resulting from various environmental
stresses. Accordingly, this instrument, when developed, can be used as a
radiation dosimeter in civil defense by swiftly detecting the degree and
type of chromosomal aberrations in blood cells. Thus, casualties in
nuclear attack could be quickly detected and treated. This system would
also be useful for nuclear industrial plants and for military maneuvers.
In medicine, various disease trends could be monitored. (Chromosomes
exhibit anomalies in leukemia and mental retardation as well as in other
states.) In space exploration and experimentation, the device can spot
monitor radiation dose levels as well as changes resulting from any of the
environmental stresses experienced in space. This apparatus can be
modified for use as an extraterrestrial-life-detecting instrument by scanning
the growth of cells (or cellular inclusions), computing rates, and
telemetering changes to the researcher.</p>
<p class="pnext">Investigations of rhythmic phenomena of various physiological systems
can result in knowledge of the utmost importance to medicine. Rhythmic
phenomena are found in the cardiovascular system of normal humans.
Changes in these rhythms have the potential of foretelling abnormalities
(heart disease, arteriosclerosis) before outward signs are manifested,
allowing for earlier diagnosis, treatment, and control or cure.</p>
<p class="pnext">The spacecraft sterilization program requires the use of rooms having
the lowest attainable level of bacterial contamination. The rate of
dissemination of bacteria from the humans in the room is basic to the
problem. Data on this matter are being obtained through support of the
Communicable Disease Center of the U.S. Public Health Service. The
findings are affecting the measures used in surgical practice to lower
infection rates.</p>
<p class="pnext">Studies on the physiology of hibernation in mammals are important to
understand temperature regulation and the mechanism of survival at
low body temperatures. The purpose of this type of research is to understand
and use reduced metabolic activity in astronauts on future extended
space flight. Other applications involve studies of the mechanisms of
injury and freezing biological organisms, for improving techniques in
hypothermic surgery, pathology, and preservation of tissue for human
grafting.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="food-and-agriculture">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title"><span class="pageno target" title="115" id="page-115"> </span>Food and Agriculture</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Gathering agricultural information by remote sensing of Earth's surface
from aircraft, balloons, and satellites has a potential application in
research and development. Current needs for data gathered in this way
include crop and livestock surveys for marketing planning; soil mapping;
crop disease, insect, and weed surveys; soil conservation management
and research; and crop acreage control programs. As population and
world trade increase, the needs will become even more intense for
regularly scheduled synoptic surveys of the world's agricultural lands for
crop plantings and harvests; determining the condition of crops as
affected by drought, disease, or insect outbreaks; and studies of the lands
suitable for agricultural development in underdeveloped countries.
The only way that worldwide synoptic surveys can be made is by using
orbiting platforms.</p>
<p class="pnext">The NASA nutrition program for developing diets for prolonged
manned and animal space flight lends itself to civil defense purposes;
military maneuvers where space and weight are prime considerations;
polar and desert exploration; reducing hunger in underdeveloped countries;
and detecting metabolic diseases as well as diseases of infancy and
old age. For space research such a diet can be used on prolonged manned
space flights, animal experiments in space, manned orbiting laboratories,
and space and planetary stations. Studies on the packaging and stability
of foods under various conditions of humidity, temperature, and radiation
will lead to better processing and storage.</p>
<p class="pnext">Learning how microbial spores are transported by air is important to
biology, agriculture, and medicine. Besides spreading crop destruction,
microbial spores produce allergic responses in some human beings. To
obtain the facts, not only the biology of micro-organisms but also the
weather factors that induce the flight of mature spores must be known.
Thus, both biological and meteorological problems are involved. Data
obtained under a NASA contract with the General Mills Electronic Division
(now part of Litton Industries, Inc.) indicate that spores of fungi are
present in low numbers in the stratosphere. A reservoir of spores exists
which cannot be brought down by the normal scrubbing mechanisms
of rainfall and other meteorological disturbances in the troposphere.
This finding has important implications for reducing the spread of
agricultural crop diseases and for protecting persons suffering from
allergies. This project has indicated the necessity for designing novel
biological samplers for use in the stratosphere. Such samplers will aid in
determining various pollutants of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="pnext">The NASA program for developing sterile spacecraft for the biological
exploration of Mars will contribute improved methods of sterilization
<span class="pageno target" title="116" id="page-116"> </span>that can be applied to the canning industry. Studies on sterilization at
low temperatures for long periods of time are being supported by NASA
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Communicable
Disease Center and the Sanitary Engineering Center of the Public Health
Service. The developing capability is making possible the heat sterilization
of products that never before could be thoroughly sterilized.</p>
<p class="pnext">In preparing for missions to search for extraterrestrial life, research
on the psychrophilic or cold bacteria, on halophytic or salt bacteria, and
on specialized bacteria and other organisms growing in extreme environments
is defining the extremes under which life can exist. Increased
knowledge about organisms that can grow in or on refrigerated, dried,
or salted foods and other materials should have practical applications
for food storage and preservation. Research on psychrophilic bacteria
is being conducted by Whirlpool Corp. and the NASA Ames Research
Center.</p>
<p class="pnext">Theoretical studies of Martian life involve investigations of plant
and bacterial spores. Many of these forms are spoilage organisms and
some produce lethal toxins. This work has potential importance for
food <span class="target" id="processing">processing</span> and for obtaining more precise knowledge of how
wounds become infected. The program for investigating possible forms
of life on Mars includes a thorough study of anaerobic micro-organisms.
This research has led to the discovery of new types of nitrogen-fixing
bacteria other than the familiar types found in the root nodules of
leguminous plants. Thus, it may be possible to use these microorganisms,
or the principles involved, in the incorporation of vital atmospheric
nitrogen into terrestrial soils which are now unproductive.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-4 section" id="industry-and-manufacturing">
<h4 class="left level-4 pfirst section-title title">Industry and Manufacturing</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Batteries that have been developed in the space program to endure
high sterilization temperatures for extended times will have greatly
increased shelf life at normal storage temperatures and will be serviceable
after many hours of baking at high temperatures.</p>
<p class="pnext">Currently, the highest quality tape recorders are subject to imperfect
reproduction because the tapes are heat labile; i.e., they soften and
stretch when warm. The development of high-quality magnetic tapes
for space-data recorders is an outgrowth of the materials developed to
meet spacecraft sterilization requirements. These improved tapes will
be useful for all types of recording—industry, automation controls, home,

for their solution lies in advances in biological theory rather than other
avenues of research; therefore, it is fortunate that the need to solve them
has come at a time when developments in experimental biology are at a
high level. In addition, technological developments in electronics and
engineering are providing new and wonderful instruments for this great
exploration into the sources of life. Many of these have had practical
application that has made possible important advances in medical
diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p class="pnext">The broad national space goals initially charted by NASA have gone
beyond space flight in near-Earth orbit to lunar and interplanetary
exploration by man and machine. For such missions, more intensive and
comprehensive research in the life sciences is needed. Before manned
voyages for extended periods into deep space will be possible, solutions
must be found for problems such as the development of bioregenerative
life-support systems, communication with nonhuman species, and the
development of new methods for transferring knowledge to the human
brain.</p>
<p class="pnext">The problems are all of the type that could perhaps be solved by truly
great advances in biological theory, and probably not by any other
avenue.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
